        "ground_truth": "Yes. The text says the contract between a tenant and landlord can be based on a written lease or a handshake, and that in New York State there are several different laws governing this relationship, which can differ depending on the county or town you live in.",

            "gpt-5.1": "Yes. In New York, landlord\u2011tenant laws apply even if you only had a verbal/handshake agreement and no written lease.\n\nKey points for NYC / NYS:\n\n1. **Verbal leases are generally valid**  \n   - If you agreed on things like rent amount and move\u2011in date, you likely have a *month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy* if the agreement was for an indefinite period.  \n   - New York\u2019s landlord\u2011tenant statutes (primarily the **Real Property Law (RPL)** and **Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (RPAPL)**) still apply.\n\n2. **Basic rights and duties don\u2019t depend on having a written lease**  \n   Even without a written lease, the law still governs things like:\n   - **How and when rent can be raised** (especially after the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act)  \n   - **Required notice to terminate** a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy  \n   - **Eviction procedures** \u2013 a landlord must go to court; they cannot just lock you out or shut off services  \n   - **Warranty of habitability** \u2013 the apartment must be safe and livable (heat, hot water, no dangerous conditions, etc.)  \n   - **Anti\u2011retaliation protections** if you complain to the landlord or to a government agency about conditions  \n   - **Security deposit rules** (if you paid one), including caps and return deadlines\n\n3. **When a written lease is required**  \n   - Certain types of tenancies (e.g., for more than one year) are supposed to be in writing under the Statute of Frauds, but in practice many tenancies without a written lease are still treated as valid month\u2011to\u2011month arrangements.  \n   - Rent\u2011stabilized apartments must have written leases, but if you\u2019re living in one without a lease, you may have rights as a tenant anyway.\n\n4. **NYC adds additional protections**  \n   - Local housing, building, and health codes apply to your unit.  \n   - The **Housing Maintenance Code** and **Multiple Dwelling Law** regulate repairs, heat/hot water, pest control, etc.  \n   - These obligations apply regardless of whether there\u2019s a written lease.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- whether you\u2019re in NYC,\n- roughly how long you\u2019ve been there,\n- what you agreed to (rent amount, how often you pay, any \u201cend date\u201d),\n\nI can explain exactly what type of tenancy you likely have and what notice and eviction rules apply in your situation.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Yes. State and New York City landlord\u2013tenant laws apply even if you only had a \u201chandshake\u201d (oral) agreement.\n\nKey points\n\n- Oral leases can create a binding tenancy. Under New York\u2019s Statute of Frauds, a lease must be in writing to be enforceable if it\u2019s for more than one year; leases for one year or less can be oral and still valid. Even without a written lease, the parties\u2019 conduct (you moved in, paid rent, landlord accepted rent) can establish tenancy.\n\n- Basic landlord obligations still apply. Landlords must provide a habitable apartment (make repairs, provide heat and hot water where required, keep common areas safe), comply with building and housing codes, and may not use illegal self-help (changing locks, shutting off utilities) to evict you.\n\n- You still have procedural protections. A landlord must use the court eviction process to remove you \u2014 they can\u2019t legally evict you by changing locks or throwing out your belongings. Required notices before eviction and other procedural rules still apply.\n\n- Rent regulation and other special rules still apply. If the unit is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled, those statutes and DHCR rules control rent increases, lease renewal, and registration regardless of whether the lease was written.\n\n- Security deposits, receipts, and records matter. Keep records (rent receipts, bank transfers, texts/emails, photos of the unit, correspondence, keys, mail at the address). Those are evidence of tenancy and can be used in Housing Court.\n\nWhat you can/should do now\n\n1. Ask for a written lease. If landlord refuses, follow up in writing (email/text) so you have proof you requested one.\n2. Keep detailed records of rent payments and communications.\n3. Request repairs in writing and keep copies.\n4. If landlord tries to evict you without court process or is harassing you, contact Housing Court or get legal help.\n5. For unsafe or housing-code violations in NYC, file a complaint with 311/NYC Housing Preservation & Development (HPD). For rent-stabilization questions, contact NYS Division of Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR).\n\nWhere to get help in NYC\n\n- 311/NYC (file HPD housing complaints)\n- NYC Housing Court Help Centers / Housing Court Answers\n- Legal Aid Society, New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), neighborhood tenant associations\n- DHCR for rent-stabilization issues\n\nIf you want, tell me (a) whether you\u2019re in NYC specifically, (b) whether you paid rent and how long you\u2019ve lived there, and (c) whether the landlord is threatening eviction or refusing repairs \u2014 I can tell you the most relevant next steps and what notice is required in your situation.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: Yes. New York law does govern landlord-tenant relationships even if your agreement was just a handshake.\n\nKey points to know\n- An informal arrangement can still create a tenancy (or, in some cases, a license). In NY, if you\u2019re living there and paying rent with the landlord\u2019s knowledge, you\u2019ve likely got at least a month-to-month tenancy, even without a written lease. If the term is expected to be longer than a year, a written lease is required by the statute of frauds to be enforceable.\n- Rights don\u2019t depend on a written contract. NY landlords and tenants have important rights and duties under state law (and, in NYC, under local rules as well). These include basic housing conditions, the right to quiet enjoyment, and certain protections against eviction without proper process.\n- Habitability and other duties apply anyway. Even with an oral deal, the landlord must keep the apartment habitable (heat, hot water, safe conditions, working plumbing, etc.) and respect your right to live there without illegal intrusion.\n- Eviction and rent rules still apply. A landlord cannot lock you out or remove you without going through the housing court. If there\u2019s a dispute (nonpayment, lease violations, etc.), it\u2019s typically resolved in court with proper notices and procedures.\n- If there\u2019s a security deposit, there are rules. If a landlord collects a security deposit, there are NY rules about how it\u2019s handled and when it must be returned with any applicable accounting or interest, though the exact requirements can depend on the type of unit and the locality.\n\n NYC-specific protections (if you\u2019re in NYC)\n- Rent-stabilized and rent-controlled units have extra protections, including renewal rights and regulated rent increases. If your unit is stabilized, you\u2019ll have additional rules about leases and renewals, even if your initial agreement was informal.\n- The NYC Housing Court and the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) administer many of these protections and can help with disputes.\n\nWhat you should do now\n- If you\u2019re unsure whether you have a tenancy or a license, or what rights apply, consider getting a written lease or at least a simple written agreement to document terms (rent amount, when it\u2019s due, and what\u2019s included).\n- Keep records: save rent receipts (even if paid in cash, note the dates and amounts), photos of any serious repair issues, and all communications with the landlord.\n- If you have a dispute or fear an illegal eviction or unsafe living conditions, contact:\n  - NYC: 311 for housing issues; HPD or Legal Aid/Legal Services NYC if you need free legal help.\n  - Outside NYC: NYS Attorney General\u2019s Real Estate or Tenant Protection resources; local legal aid.\n- If you want, tell me your city (NYC vs elsewhere in NYS) and whether the apartment is stabilized, and I can give more targeted guidance about notices, renewal rights, and who to contact.\n\nNote: This is general information and not legal advice. If you\u2019re facing a specific situation (eviction notices, entry requests, or a dispute about repairs), a housing attorney or legal aid clinic can provide advice tailored to your facts.",
            "Llama 4 Scout": "In New York City, the landlord-tenant relationship is governed by both state and city laws. While a handshake deal may be considered a valid agreement, it's essential to understand that verbal agreements can be difficult to enforce.\n\nNew York State has laws that govern the landlord-tenant relationship, including the New York State Real Property Law and the New York State Tenant Protection Act of 2019. Additionally, New York City has its own set of laws, including the New York City Rent Stabilization Law and the NYC Housing Maintenance Code.\n\nEven with a verbal agreement, landlords and tenants still have rights and responsibilities under these laws. For example:\n\n* Landlords are required to provide a safe and habitable living environment, maintain the premises, and make necessary repairs.\n* Tenants are responsible for paying rent, keeping the premises clean and safe, and not causing damage to the property.\n\nIt's recommended that you document any agreements, including verbal ones, in writing to avoid misunderstandings. If you're experiencing issues with your landlord or tenant, it's best to consult with a housing law expert or a qualified attorney for guidance.",
            "GPT 4.1": "Yes, New York State has laws that govern the landlord-tenant relationship, even if you only had a handshake deal and do not have a written lease. In New York, an oral (verbal) rental agreement is legally binding and creates a tenancy, usually a month-to-month tenancy if rent is paid monthly.\n\nKey points:\n\n- **Basic Rights and Responsibilities:** Both landlords and tenants have rights and responsibilities under New York State law, regardless of whether the agreement is written or oral.\n- **Notice Requirements:** For example, to end a month-to-month tenancy, the landlord or tenant must give proper written notice, as required by law.\n- **Security Deposits:** Laws about security deposits, repairs, habitability, and eviction procedures apply to all residential tenancies, not just those with written leases.\n- **Rent Stabilization/Rent Control:** If the apartment is subject to rent stabilization or rent control, those laws apply regardless of whether there is a written lease.\n\n**References:**\n- [NY Attorney General\u2019s Tenant\u2019s Rights Guide](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tenants_rights.pdf)\n- [NYC Rent Guidelines Board: Oral Leases](https://www.nycrgb.org/html/resources/faq/oral.html)\n\n**In summary:** Even with a handshake deal, New York State law protects both landlords and tenants. It\u2019s always best to have a written lease, but your rights and obligations are still enforceable under state law.",
            "Mistral on-site": "Yes, New York State has laws that govern the landlord-tenant relationship, even if you only had a handshake deal. In New York, an oral lease is legally binding, but it's important to note that certain provisions must be in writing to be enforceable. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Lease Terms**: Oral leases are generally valid for terms of one year or less. If the lease term is more than one year, it must be in writing to be enforceable.\n\n2. **Required Written Provisions**: Certain provisions must be in writing to be enforceable, regardless of the lease term. These include:\n   - The entire agreement and any modifications must be in writing if the tenancy is for more than one year.\n   - Any agreement to waive the landlord's obligation to repair and maintain the premises.\n   - Any agreement to waive the tenant's right to a jury trial.\n   - Any agreement to waive the tenant's right to raise certain defenses, such as the warranty of habitability.\n\n3. **Implied Warranty of Habitability**: Even without a written lease, landlords in New York City are required to provide a safe and habitable living environment. This includes providing heat, hot water, and making necessary repairs.\n\n4. **Rent Stabilization and Rent Control**: If your apartment is subject to rent stabilization or rent control, specific rules apply, and you should be aware of your rights and the landlord's obligations under these programs.\n\n5. **Security Deposit**: If you paid a security deposit, the landlord must follow specific rules regarding its handling and return.\n\n6. **Eviction Procedures**: If there is a dispute, the landlord must follow proper eviction procedures, which include providing notice and obtaining a court order.\n\nEven with a handshake deal, it's crucial to understand your rights and the landlord's obligations under New York State and New York City laws. If you have any disputes or questions, it may be helpful to consult with a legal professional or a tenant advocacy organization.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, absolutely! You are right to be confused, as it can be a complex area, but here's a clear breakdown for NYC:\n\n1.  **New York State Laws Govern Landlord-Tenant Relationships:**\n    New York State has a comprehensive set of laws (primarily in the Real Property Law and the General Obligations Law) that govern the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants. These laws apply statewide, regardless of whether you have a written lease or just a handshake deal.\n\n2.  **New York City Has *Additional* and Often *Stronger* Protections:**\n    On top of the state laws, New York City has its own set of laws (like the NYC Administrative Code and the Housing Maintenance Code) that provide even more protections for tenants. These NYC-specific laws are crucial for anyone renting in the five boroughs.\n\n3.  **The \"Handshake Deal\" (Oral Agreement) is Generally Valid, With a Key Exception:**\n\n    *   **For Leases Less Than One Year:** An oral agreement (a handshake deal) for a lease term of **less than one year** is generally legally binding and enforceable in New York. The terms you agreed upon (rent amount, due date, who pays utilities, etc.) are legally valid, even if not written down.\n    *   **For Leases One Year or More (Statute of Frauds):** There's a critical legal principle called the \"Statute of Frauds.\" This law generally requires that any agreement that *cannot be performed within one year* (like a lease for a term of one year or longer) **must be in writing** to be legally enforceable. If you had a handshake deal for, say, a two-year lease, it might not be enforceable in court if one party backs out, because it wasn't in writing. However, if you've already moved in and are paying rent, an oral agreement for a term longer than a year can still create a month-to-month tenancy.\n\n**Key Protections That *Always* Apply (Regardless of Lease Type or Whether it's Written):**\n\nEven with just a handshake deal, you are still protected by fundamental tenant rights under NY State and NYC law:\n\n*   **Implied Warranty of Habitability:** Your landlord must provide and maintain a safe, livable, and sanitary apartment. This means they must keep the building in good repair, provide heat, hot water, and essential services, and address issues like pests, leaks, or dangerous conditions. This cannot be waived, even in a written lease.\n*   **Proper Eviction Procedures:** A landlord cannot simply kick you out. They must follow specific legal procedures, which involve giving you proper notice and obtaining a court order through a Housing Court proceeding. \"Self-help\" evictions (like changing locks, turning off utilities, or removing your belongings) are illegal.\n*   **Anti-Discrimination Laws:** Landlords cannot discriminate against you based on protected characteristics (race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, source of income, etc.).\n*   **Anti-Retaliation Laws:** Your landlord cannot retaliate against you (e.g., by trying to evict you or refusing to renew your lease) for asserting your legal rights, such as complaining about conditions or joining a tenant association.\n*   **Security Deposit Rules:** There are limits on how much a landlord can charge for a security deposit (one month's rent in NYC) and strict rules about how it must be held and returned.\n*   **Rent Stabilization/Control:** This is a huge one for NYC. If your building is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled, those protections apply to you *even if you only have an oral agreement* and even if your landlord tries to claim otherwise. The status of the building determines this, not your lease.\n\n**Important Considerations for Handshake Deals:**\n\nWhile legally valid for terms under a year, oral agreements are inherently more difficult to prove. If a dispute arises, it becomes your word against your landlord's. This is why it's always strongly recommended to get everything in writing.\n\n**In summary:** Yes, New York State and New York City have extensive laws governing landlord-tenant relationships, and many of these protections apply even if you only had a handshake deal. However, for your own protection, always try to get a written lease and keep detailed records of all communications and payments.\n\nIf you have specific concerns about your situation, it's always best to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant advocacy organization.",
            "llama3": "Don't worry, it's understandable to be confused!\n\nYes, in New York State, the landlord-tenant relationship is governed by state laws and regulations, regardless of whether you have a formal lease agreement or just a handshake deal. The Residential Rent Act (RRA) and the Housing Maintenance Code (HMC) are the primary laws that regulate the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants.\n\nEven if you don't have a written lease, the RRA and HMC still apply to your tenancy. These laws cover issues like:\n\n1. Security deposits: Landlords must return security deposits within 14 days after a tenant moves out.\n2. Rent increases: Landlords must provide a 30-day notice before raising rents.\n3. Lease renewal: Tenants can request a lease renewal, and landlords must respond within 10 days.\n4. Eviction: Landlords must follow specific procedures for eviction, including providing written notices to the tenant.\n5. Repairs and maintenance: Landlords are responsible for maintaining the property's habitability.\n\nThe RRA also establishes certain rights for tenants, such as:\n\n1. Right to quiet enjoyment: Tenants have a right to enjoy their rental unit without interference from the landlord or other tenants.\n2. Right to privacy: Tenants have a right to privacy in their rental unit and are entitled to a reasonable amount of time before a landlord can enter the premises.\n\nWhile having a written lease agreement is always recommended, even a handshake deal can be considered an oral lease, which is still subject to the laws and regulations mentioned above. If you're experiencing issues with your landlord, it's essential to familiarize yourself with these laws and seek legal advice if necessary.\n\nRemember, in New York State, even verbal agreements can become binding contracts, so it's crucial to understand your rights and responsibilities as a tenant, regardless of whether you have a written lease or not."

            "gpt-5.1": "In NYC there\u2019s no single public list, so you figure it out by checking several clues and records. Here\u2019s a practical step\u2011by\u2011step way to do it:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Check basic building facts\n\nFirst find out:\n\n- **Building size:** How many apartments?\n- **Building age:** Year built or first occupied.\n- **Type of building:** Regular apartment house, co\u2011op, condo, etc.\n\nYou can get this from:\n- **NYC Dept. of Buildings (DOB) BIS or DOB NOW**:  \n  https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp  \n  Search by address \u2192 see \u201cUnits\u201d and \u201cYear Built.\u201d\n- **NYC Department of Finance / ACRIS / Property tax bill** to see if it\u2019s a co\u2011op/condo.\n\nKey rules (general, with exceptions):\n\n- **Rent stabilized \u2013 usually**:\n  - Buildings with **6+ units built between 1947\u20131973**, **and** not substantially rehabbed or deregulated.\n  - Some post\u20111974 buildings that got **J\u201151**, **421\u2011a**, or similar tax benefits.\n- **Rent controlled \u2013 usually**:\n  - Tenants (or their lawful successors) who have been in the same apartment **continuously since before July 1, 1971**, in buildings built before 1947 with 6+ units.\n- **More likely unregulated** if:\n  - Building has **fewer than 6 units** (unless it\u2019s part of a larger complex treated as one building or a special program).\n  - It\u2019s a **condo or co\u2011op and you rent from an individual owner** (though some units in these can still be stabilized).\n  - It\u2019s a **1\u2013 or 2\u2011family home** that isn\u2019t covered by a special program.\n\nThese are only indicators. The real test is the legal rent history.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Request the official rent history from DHCR\n\nThe **New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)** is the rent regulation agency. They keep rent registration records for rent\u2011stabilized apartments.\n\nIf your apartment has ever been registered as rent stabilized since 1984, DHCR usually has a record.\n\n**How to get it (free):**\n\n- Online form: https://hcr.ny.gov/tenant\n- Or call DHCR\u2019s Rent Info Line: (718) 739\u20116400\n- Or visit a local DHCR borough office with:\n  - Your name\n  - Address, apartment number\n  - Photo ID\n  - A copy of your lease (recommended)\n\n**What to look for in the history:**\n\n- Does it show registrations listing:\n  - \u201cRent Stabilized\u201d or registration status each year?\n  - Legal regulated rent, tenant name, and registration years?\n- If there is a consistent registration history and legal regulated rents, that\u2019s strong evidence the apartment is\u2014or was\u2014rent stabilized.\n- If there are years missing or it suddenly stops being registered, that may signal **potentially improper deregulation**, especially after June 14, 2019, when most deregulation pathways were abolished.\n\nNote: **Rent\u2011controlled** apartments may not appear in the same way on rent histories; those are tracked differently, often as \u201crent controlled\u201d or through DHCR\u2019s Office of Rent Administration.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Look at your lease and rider\n\nFor **rent\u2011stabilized** apartments, the landlord must give you:\n\n1. A **standard form rent\u2011stabilized lease** (RTP\u20118 form or its successor), and  \n2. A **DHCR Rent Stabilization Lease Rider** that:\n   - Identifies the apartment as rent stabilized,\n   - States the legal regulated rent,\n   - Explains how your rent was calculated,\n   - Explains your rights under rent stabilization.\n\nIf:\n- Your lease is on the RTP\u20118 form or explicitly says \u201crent stabilized,\u201d and\n- You got a DHCR rent stabilization rider,\n\nthen the landlord is treating the apartment as rent stabilized.\n\nLack of a rider **does not necessarily mean** it isn\u2019t stabilized; many landlords fail to provide it even when they should.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Check registration status via DHCR (landlord side)\n\nYou can also ask DHCR:\n\n- \u201cIs my apartment currently registered as rent stabilized?\u201d\n- Sometimes DHCR staff will tell you, on the phone or at an office, whether the landlord has filed recent rent registrations for that unit.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Use indirect clues (not definitive, but suggestive)\n\nThese are **not legal tests**, but they help:\n\n### a. Rent level\nThere is no strict \u201ccap\u201d for stabilized rent, but many stabilized units are **below market** for their neighborhood, especially when long\u2011term tenants lived there. After the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA), **high\u2011rent vacancy deregulation was eliminated**, so today even higher\u2011rent apartments can be stabilized.\n\n### b. Renewal rights\n- In a rent\u2011stabilized apartment, the landlord **must offer renewal leases** (usually 1\u2011 or 2\u2011year terms) with increases limited by the **Rent Guidelines Board (RGB)**.\n- If your landlord insists they can just not renew you without a specific legal ground (e.g., nonpayment, owner occupancy), that may suggest they are claiming it\u2019s unregulated\u2014but that claim may be wrong.\n\n### c. Prior tenant clues\nIf you can contact prior tenants, ask:\n- \u201cDid you have a rent\u2011stabilized lease?\u201d\n- \u201cDid you get a DHCR rider?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 6. Beware of improper deregulation and mislabeling\n\nMany apartments that **should be** rent stabilized are treated as \u201cfree market\u201d because of:\n\n- Failure to register with DHCR,\n- Unlawful \u201chigh\u2011rent\u201d deregulation prior to 2019,\n- Overstated renovation costs (IAIs/MCIs) used to deregulate or jack up rent,\n- Landlords just telling tenants it\u2019s \u201cmarket rate\u201d with nothing to back it up.\n\nEven if:\n- Your current lease says \u201cunregulated\u201d or \u201cfree market,\u201d or\n- You never got a rider,\n\nthe apartment **may still legally be rent stabilized** if it meets the criteria and the rent history shows unlawful increases or improper deregulation.\n\nIn those situations, tenants sometimes file:\n- An **\u201covercharge\u201d or \u201cstatus\u201d complaint** with DHCR, or\n- A lawsuit in **Housing Court or Supreme Court** (usually with a lawyer) to declare the unit rent stabilized and roll back rent.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Special programs and exceptions\n\nYour apartment might be subject to **other regulation systems** instead of (or in addition to) rent stabilization, including:\n\n- **NYC Housing Authority (NYCHA)**\n- **Section 8 (project\u2011based or voucher)**\n- **Mitchell\u2011Lama**\n- **Inclusionary Housing / 421\u2011a / 421\u2011g / J\u201151 buildings** with regulatory agreements\n- **HDFC** co\u2011ops with income restrictions\n\nIn those cases, your rent and rights are governed by **program rules** and/or **regulatory agreements**, but often *also* by rent stabilization when applicable (e.g., some 421\u2011a units).\n\nYou can check:\n- Building\u2019s **tax benefit history** via NYC Dept. of Finance or HPD.\n- HPD\u2019s \u201cHousing Connect\u201d or \u201cMitchell\u2011Lama\u201d lists if you suspect that type of housing.\n\n---\n\n## 8. When to get legal help\n\nConsider speaking with a **tenant lawyer** or **tenant advocacy group** if:\n\n- DHCR history shows:\n  - Big unexplained jumps,\n  - Sudden deregulation,\n  - Missing years.\n- The building clearly fits rent\u2011stabilization criteria (e.g., 6+ units, 1947\u20131973) but landlord claims it\u2019s \u201cfree market.\u201d\n- You are facing a **large rent increase** or a **non\u2011renewal** of your lease.\n\nFree/low\u2011cost help (NYC):\n\n- **Legal Aid Society / Legal Services NYC / NYLAG**\n- **Housing Court Answers**: https://housingcourtanswers.org\n- **Right to Counsel** (if you\u2019re being sued in Housing Court and qualify by income)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Summary checklist\n\nTo figure out if your apartment is rent regulated:\n\n1. **Check building info**: units, year built (DOB site).\n2. **Request rent history from DHCR** (strongest evidence).\n3. **Examine your lease**: is it a rent\u2011stabilized form? Did you get the DHCR rider?\n4. **Ask DHCR about registration** for your unit.\n5. **Look for clues**: prior tenants, renewal rights, long\u2011term low rent in a qualifying building.\n6. **If things don\u2019t add up**, consult a tenant attorney or help organization; you may be in a misclassified stabilized unit.\n\nIf you share your building\u2019s year built, number of units, and whether you\u2019ve ever gotten a DHCR rider or rent history, I can help you interpret how likely it is that your apartment is rent regulated.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer\n- The two NYC forms of legal regulation are rent control (rare) and rent stabilization. You find out by checking your lease and rent history, asking the landlord in writing, and, if necessary, getting an official rent history/registration from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). DHCR\u2019s rent history/registration is the definitive source.\n\nWhat to look for (quick indicators)\n- Lease language or rider that says \u201cRent Stabilized\u201d or \u201cRent Controlled.\u201d Landlords must give a Rent Stabilization Rider with stabilized leases.\n- A long continuous tenancy that began before July 1, 1971 in a pre\u20111947 building \u2192 possible rent control (very rare).\n- Building built/first occupied between Feb. 1, 1947 and Jan. 1, 1974 with 6+ units \u2192 commonly rent\u2011stabilized.\n- Any building receiving certain tax benefits or government programs (J\u201151, older 421\u2011a benefits, some HPD financing, Loft Law protection, etc.) may be stabilized even if built outside the dates above.\n- If you were offered a lease renewal and the landlord must follow annual Rent Guidelines Board increases \u2192 likely stabilized.\n\nDefinitive check\n1. Ask your landlord in writing whether the apartment is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled and request the rent history/registration for your unit. Keep a copy of the request.\n2. Request an official rent history from the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). DHCR\u2019s rent history and registration records will show whether the unit has been registered as stabilized/controlled and the legal rent history.\n   - Go to DHCR/HCR\u2019s website (search \u201cNY HCR rent history\u201d or \u201cDHCR rent history request\u201d) or call their tenant information line for instructions.\n3. If the landlord refuses or you suspect misclassification, contact:\n   - DHCR (for rent regulation and rent history/recovery of overcharges),\n   - NYC 311/HPD for building-level information,\n   - or a tenant attorney/legal\u2011aid organization (e.g., Legal Aid Society, Legal Services, Met Council on Housing).\n\nA short sample request to your landlord\n\u201cPlease confirm in writing whether the apartment at [address], apt [#], is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled. If it is, please provide the current DHCR registration and the unit\u2019s rent history. If it is not, please state that in writing. Please respond within 10 business days.\u201d\n\nWhen classification matters\nIf your unit is stabilized or controlled you have lease renewal rights, limits on increases (subject to Rent Guidelines Board rules for stabilized units), and rights to see rent history. Misclassification can lead to rent overcharge claims.\n\nIf you want, tell me your building address and the date you moved in (or the date the building was built) and I\u2019ll tell you the most likely classification and next steps to get an official rent history.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer\n- In NYC, \u201crent regulated\u201d usually means your unit is rent-stabilized (or, rarely, rent-controlled). The rest are generally \u201cunregulated\u201d (market rate).\n\nHow to tell for sure\n- Step 1: Check the lease and any notices\n  - If the lease or a lease rider says the apartment is rent stabilized or mentions a regulated rent, that\u2019s a strong sign.\n  - If the lease is clearly market-rate with no reference to stabilization, that\u2019s a hint but not definitive.\n\n- Step 2: Ask the landlord for a current rent history or the unit\u2019s registered rent\n  - Landlords in stabilized buildings must maintain annual rent registrations with DHCR and should be able to provide the current \u201clegal\u201d (registrable) and actual rents for your unit.\n  - You can request the rent history and the \u201clegal rent\u201d from the landlord.\n\n- Step 3: Look up the unit/building with DHCR (state rent-regulation agency)\n  - The NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) has online tools to check whether a building is rent-regulated. You can search by building address to see if the building has rent-stabilized units (and sometimes the unit\u2019s status).\n  - You can also check the unit\u2019s registered rent history for your specific apartment through DHCR\u2019s online resources (requires the unit address and sometimes the unit number).\n\n- Step 4: Use HPD\u2019s tenant-facing resources\n  - New York City\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) maintains guidance and a page like \u201cIs My Building Rent Stabilized?\u201d that can help you determine if your building is subject to rent stabilization.\n\n- Step 5: Consider other possibilities (exemptions and special cases)\n  - Some buildings with fewer than 6 units are not covered by rent stabilization.\n  - Buildings completed after a certain date, or buildings that later became exempt, may be unregulated.\n  - Within stabilized housing, some units may have a \u201cpreferential rent\u201d and a separate \u201clegal rent.\u201d The unit\u2019s lease terms will reflect that disparity at times.\n  - Vacant-unit rules and deregulation thresholds have changed over time; the status can change with major renovations or vacancy events, so it\u2019s best to confirm with DHCR if you\u2019re concerned about deregulation.\n\nWhat I\u2019d recommend you do now\n- Ask your landlord for:\n  - The current legal rent for your unit\n  - Your unit\u2019s rent history (past rents and increases)\n  - A copy of the last DHCR rent registration for your unit (if they have it)\n- Then check:\n  - DHCR\u2019s \u201cIs my building rent regulated?\u201d tool (and any state DHCR guidance)\n  - HPD\u2019s guidance page for Is My Building Rent Stabilized?\n- If you\u2019re still unsure or hit any roadblocks, consider contacting a tenants\u2019 rights group or a housing attorney who can review the documents and confirm the status for your exact unit.\n\nNote: This is general guidance. For your specific unit, the definitive sources are the DHCR and the landlord\u2019s rent-registration records. If you\u2019d like, tell me your building\u2019s address and unit number (if you\u2019re comfortable), and I can point you to the most relevant DHCR/HPD resources for that unit.",

Here are the key points to consider:\n\n### Rent-Regulated Apartments\nRent-regulated apartments in New York City include rent-stabilized and rent-controlled units. Here's how to determine if your apartment falls into one of these categories:\n\n1. **Rent-Stabilized Apartments:**\n   - **Building Size:** The building must contain six or more units and have been built between February 1, 1947, and January 1, 1974.\n   - **Tenancy:** The apartment must have been continuously occupied since July 1, 1971, or the tenant must have been in occupancy since July 1, 1971.\n   - **Registration:** The apartment must be registered with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).\n   - **Lease:** Your lease should indicate that the apartment is rent-stabilized. Look for language that mentions rent stabilization or the DHCR.\n\n2. **Rent-Controlled Apartments:**\n   - **Occupancy:** The tenant must have been in continuous occupancy since July 1, 1971, or before.\n   - **Building Size:** The building must contain three or more units.\n   - **Rent Level:** The rent must be below a certain threshold set by the DHCR.\n   - **Registration:** The apartment must be registered with the DHCR.\n   - **Lease:** Your lease should indicate that the apartment is rent-controlled.\n\n### Unregulated Apartments\nAn apartment is considered unregulated if it does not meet the criteria for rent stabilization or rent control. This typically includes:\n\n- **New Construction:** Buildings constructed after January 1, 1974, are generally not rent-stabilized unless they receive J-51 or 421-a tax benefits.\n- **Co-ops and Condos:** Units in cooperative or condominium buildings are usually not rent-regulated.\n- **Market-Rate Apartments:** Apartments in buildings with fewer than six units are generally not rent-regulated.\n- **Luxury Apartments:** Apartments with high rents (above a certain threshold set by the DHCR) may be deregulated.\n\n### How to Verify\n1. **Check Your Lease:** Look for any mention of rent stabilization or rent control.\n2. **Contact the DHCR:** You can call the DHCR at (718) 739-6400 or visit their website to check the status of your apartment.\n3. **Ask Your Landlord:** Your landlord should be able to provide information about whether your apartment is rent-regulated.\n4. **Review Building Records:** Check public records or ask the building's management for information about the building's history and any tax benefits it may have received.\n\nIf you are unsure, it may be helpful to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant advocacy group for further assistance.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Determining whether your New York City apartment is rent regulated or unregulated can be complex, but there are several key indicators and reliable methods to find out.\n\nHere's how you can investigate your apartment's status:\n\n## The Two Main Types of Rent Regulation in NYC:\n\n1.  **Rent Stabilization:** This is the most common form of rent regulation in NYC, covering hundreds of thousands of apartments.\n2.  **Rent Control:** This is much rarer, applying to tenants who have been in continuous occupancy since July 1, 1971.\n\n## How to Determine if Your Apartment is Rent Stabilized:\n\nMost people asking about \"rent regulation\" are referring to rent stabilization. Here are the primary ways to check:\n\n### 1. The Most Reliable Method: Request Your Apartment's Rent History from DHCR\n\nThe **New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)**, specifically the **Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)**, is the state agency that oversees rent regulation. They maintain records of rent-stabilized apartments.\n\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   **Online:** You can often find information using HCR's \"Rent Info\" or \"Building Search\" tools on their website.\n    *   **Formal Request:** The most definitive way is to submit a **\"Request for Rent History\" (Form RA-H)** to DHCR. You'll need your building address and apartment number. DHCR will provide you with a printout of the apartment's registered rents for the past several years (typically back to 1984, if available).\n    *   **What to look for:** If the apartment has a rent history registered with DHCR, it's a strong indicator that it is (or was) rent stabilized. The history will show the registered rent, lease terms, and any increases.\n\n### 2. Check Your Lease and Lease Riders\n\n*   **Rent Stabilization Rider:** Landlords of rent-stabilized apartments are legally required to provide a **Rent Stabilization Rider** with the lease. This rider explains your rights as a rent-stabilized tenant. If you have one, your apartment is rent stabilized.\n*   **Specific Clauses:** Look for any language in your lease that mentions rent stabilization, DHCR, or specific rent increase percentages.\n*   **\"Free Market\" or \"Unregulated\" Language:** If your lease explicitly states the apartment is \"free market\" or \"unregulated,\" it's a strong indicator, but not always definitive if the apartment *should* be regulated.\n\n### 3. General Building Characteristics (Strong Indicators, Not Proof)\n\nWhile not definitive on their own, these characteristics make it highly likely an apartment *should* be rent stabilized:\n\n*   **Building Age:** The building was built before **January 1, 1974**.\n*   **Number of Units:** The building contains **six or more units**.\n*   **Tax Abatements:** The building receives certain tax abatements, such as **J-51** or **421-a**. Even if built after 1974, apartments in buildings receiving these abatements can be rent stabilized for the duration of the abatement period. You can check for these abatements on the NYC Department of Finance website (ACRIS or Property Tax Bills).\n\n### 4. Ask Your Landlord (Use with Caution)\n\nYou can ask your landlord or building management directly. However, be aware that they may not always provide accurate information, especially if the apartment was illegally deregulated. Always verify their claims with DHCR.\n\n### 5. Ask Your Neighbors\n\nIf you have neighbors who have lived in the building for a long time, they might know the status of their own apartments or the building in general. This can provide valuable context.\n\n### 6. Consult Tenant Rights Organizations or Legal Aid\n\nIf you're unsure or suspect your apartment might be illegally deregulated, contact a tenant rights organization (e.g., Met Council on Housing, Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC) or a private attorney specializing in tenant law. They can help you interpret DHCR records and advise on your rights.\n\n## How to Determine if Your Apartment is Rent Controlled:\n\nRent control is much rarer. To be rent controlled, a tenant (or their lawful successor) must have been living in the apartment continuously since **July 1, 1971**.\n\n*   **DHCR is the Key:** The only reliable way to confirm rent control status is through DHCR records. If an apartment is rent controlled, it will be clearly indicated in its rent history.\n*   **Succession Rights:** Rent control can pass to family members under specific succession rules, but this is also strictly regulated.\n\n## Important Considerations:\n\n*   **Deregulation:** Before the **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)**, apartments could be deregulated if the rent reached a certain threshold (high-rent vacancy deregulation) or if the tenant's income was above a certain amount (high-income deregulation). The HSTPA largely eliminated these pathways for deregulation, making it much harder for landlords to remove apartments from stabilization.\n*   **Illegal Deregulation:** Some landlords illegally deregulated apartments, claiming they were \"free market\" when they should have remained stabilized. If you suspect this, a rent history request from DHCR is crucial.\n*   **Rent Overcharge:** If your apartment is rent stabilized and your landlord is charging you more than the legal regulated rent, you may have a rent overcharge claim.\n\nBy following these steps, especially requesting your rent history from DHCR, you should be able to accurately determine the rent regulation status of your New York City apartment.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, apartments can be either rent-regulated or unregulated. Here's how to determine which category your apartment falls under:\n\n**Rent-Regulated Apartments:**\n\n1. **Stabilized Rent:**\n\t* If your apartment was stabilized on or before July 29, 2019, it's subject to the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL).\n\t* The RSL applies to apartments that were rented at a stabilized rent prior to July 29, 2019.\n2. **Rent Control:**\n\t* If your apartment is in a building with fewer than six units and was built before October 1, 1920, it's subject to the Rent Control Law (RCL).\n3. **J-51 Program:**\n\t* Some apartments in buildings that participated in the J-51 program (a rent regulation program from the 1940s to the 1990s) may still be rent-regulated.\n\n**Unregulated Apartments:**\n\n1. **Luxury Decontrol:**\n\t* If your apartment was decontrolled (removed from rent regulation) due to renovations, such as a major capital improvement project, it's considered unregulated.\n2. **Unregulated Lease:**\n\t* If you signed an unregulated lease agreement after July 29, 2019, the apartment is not subject to rent regulation.\n\nTo confirm whether your New York City apartment is rent-regulated or unregulated:\n\n1. Check your lease: Look for language indicating that your apartment is rent-regulated.\n2. Contact your landlord: Reach out to your landlord or property manager and ask if your apartment is rent-regulated.\n3. Check with the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) or the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB): These agencies can provide information on rent regulation status.\n\nKeep in mind that even if your apartment is unregulated, you may still be protected by other tenant laws, such as the New York State's Security Deposit Law."

You can do a quick screen using a few basic facts about your building and your own tenancy.\n\nIn NYC, \u201crent control\u201d is very narrow and mostly applies to long\u2011term, older tenants. Use this checklist:\n\n1. **When was the building built?**  \n   - Rent control generally applies only to buildings **built before February 1, 1947**.  \n   - If your building was built after that, it is almost certainly **not** rent controlled (it might still be rent\u2011stabilized, which is different).\n\n2. **How many apartments are in the building?**  \n   - Classic rent control covered buildings with **3+ residential units** built before 2/1/1947.  \n   - A 1\u2011 or 2\u2011family home normally won\u2019t be under rent control (there are rare exceptions, e.g., certain rooming houses or very old situations).\n\n3. **How long has the tenant been there?**  \n   - In NYC, rent control usually exists only where the same family (or continuous succession) has been in the apartment **continuously since before July 1, 1971**.  \n   - If you (or your family) **did not live there before 1971** and did not inherit/succeed from someone who did, your unit is almost certainly not rent controlled.\n\n4. **Is the apartment registered as rent\u2011stabilized instead?**  \n   - Many older buildings are **rent\u2011stabilized**, not rent\u2011controlled.  \n   - You can request your rent history from NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR):  \n     - Online: \u201cRent Regulated Building Search\u201d and \u201cRent History\u201d request on the HCR website  \n     - By phone: HCR Rent Info Line: (718) 739\u20116400  \n   - If HCR records show it as rent\u2011stabilized or unregulated, it\u2019s not rent\u2011controlled.\n\n5. **Quick \u201crule-of-thumb\u201d test for rent control**  \n   Your unit *might* be rent controlled if all of the following are true:\n   - The building was **built before 2/1/1947**  \n   - Has **3 or more units**  \n   - You or a family member have lived there **continuously since before 7/1/1971** (or you succeeded from such a tenant)  \n   - The apartment has **never had a vacancy** that broke that chain\n\nIf any of those is missing (especially the long\u2011term occupancy), the apartment is almost certainly not rent controlled.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The building\u2019s approximate year of construction  \n- Number of units  \n- When you (or your family) first moved in  \n\nand I can walk you through how likely rent control is in your specific case and whether to check with HCR.",

(Most regulated NYC apartments today are rent\u2011stabilized, not rent\u2011controlled; true rent\u2011controlled units are increasingly rare.)\n\nEasy ways to check\n1. Look up the building year\n   - Use the NYC Department of Buildings Building Information Search or ACRIS/DOF property records to find the year the building was built. If it\u2019s 1947 or later, it\u2019s not rent\u2011controlled.\n\n2. Find out when the tenancy began\n   - Ask the tenant or landlord for the original lease start date or look for old leases/records. If the original occupancy began after July 1, 1971, it\u2019s not rent\u2011controlled.\n\n3. Get an official rent history from NY State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR)\n   - HCR\u2019s Office of Rent Administration can provide the unit\u2019s rent history and will show whether it is listed as rent\u2011controlled or rent\u2011stabilized. This is the most reliable way to know. You can request a rent history through HCR\u2019s website or by mail (there may be a small fee).\n\n4. Practical signs\n   - Very low, long\u2011unchanged rents and very long\u2011term occupants are a tip that a unit might be controlled \u2014 but only the HCR rent history confirms it.\n\nIf you want, tell me the building address and I can point you to the DOB or property record page and walk you through requesting a rent history.

Rent control is rare and usually only in a few very old buildings. A quick way to tell is to look for rent-stabilization indicators and then confirm with official sources.\n\nEasy checks you can do:\n\n- Look at your lease and notices:\n  - If your lease or rider says \u201crent stabilized\u201d (or there\u2019s a rent-stabilized rider included), you\u2019re almost certainly under rent stabilization.\n  - If you get annual rent increase notices tied to a specific RGB (Rent Guidelines Board) schedule, that\u2019s another strong sign you\u2019re stabilized.\n  - If the lease mentions a fixed, non\u2013RGB-based increase, you\u2019re likely not stabilized.\n\n- Check the building\u2019s basics:\n  - If the building was built before 1974 and has 6+ units, it\u2019s commonly rent-stabilized (though there are exceptions). If it was built before 1947, there\u2019s a small chance some units could be rent-controlled, but that regime is extremely uncommon today.\n\n- Ask the landlord (or property manager) for the status:\n  - They should be able to tell you whether your unit is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled and provide the appropriate rider or notices.\n\n- Use official sources to verify:\n  - New York State DHCR (Division of Housing and Community Renewal) has tools to check if a building has rent-regulated units. You can search by address to see if the property is listed as rent-regulated.\n  - NYC HPD or the NYS DHCR websites offer guidance on how rent stabilization works and how to verify status.\n\n- Be aware of nuances:\n  - A building can have both stabilized and non-stabilized units.\n  - Status can change due to deregulation, major renovations, or conversions (e.g., to condos/co-ops).\n  - Even if a building is generally stabilized, individual leases may vary by unit.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your building\u2019s address (or just the neighborhood and year built, if you prefer not to share the exact address), and I can walk you through the exact DHCR/HPD checks for that property and interpret any results.",

Rent Control vs. Rent Stabilization\n\n*   **Rent Control:** This is very rare. It generally applies to buildings built before February 1, 1947, where the tenant (or their lawful successor) has been living there continuously since July 1, 1971. These units are typically occupied by long-term, often elderly, tenants.\n*   **Rent Stabilization:** This is much more prevalent. It applies to most buildings built before January 1, 1974, with six or more units. It can also apply to newer buildings (or those with fewer than 6 units) if the landlord received certain tax abatements (like J-51 or 421-a) or if the building was substantially rehabilitated.\n\n### Easy Ways to Get Clues (Indicators):\n\n1.  **Building Age and Size:**\n    *   **If your building was built before January 1, 1974, AND has six or more residential units, it is highly likely to be rent stabilized.** This is the strongest initial indicator.\n    *   *Caveat:* Some units may have been legally deregulated if the rent exceeded a certain threshold and the tenant's income was high enough, or if the unit became vacant after certain dates (though many deregulation pathways were eliminated or restricted by the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019).\n\n2.  **Look at Your Lease:**\n    *   **Rent stabilized apartments are legally required to have a Rent Stabilization Rider attached to the lease.** This rider outlines your rights as a stabilized tenant. If you have one, your apartment is stabilized.\n    *   *Caveat:* The absence of a rider doesn't automatically mean it's *not* stabilized, as some landlords might omit it illegally.\n\n3.  **Check for Tax Abatements (J-51 or 421-a):**\n    *   Even if your building is newer or has fewer than 6 units, it could be rent stabilized if the landlord received a J-51 or 421-a tax abatement. These abatements often come with a requirement for rent stabilization for the duration of the abatement.\n    *   You can sometimes find this information by searching your building's address on the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) website (HPD Online) or the NYC Department of Finance (ACRIS) website.\n\n### The Most Definitive Way (Official Verification):\n\nThe most accurate way to determine if your apartment is rent stabilized (or controlled) is to contact the **NYS Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR)**, which is the state agency that administers rent regulation.\n\n1.  **Request Your Apartment's Rent History:**\n    *   You can request a \"Rent History\" for your specific apartment from DHCR. This document will show if the apartment has been registered as rent stabilized (or controlled) and its rent history over time.\n    *   You can do this by filling out a **\"Tenant's Request for Rent History\" (Form RA-89)**. You can find this form on the DHCR website or by calling them.\n    *   **DHCR Contact Information:**\n        *   **Website:** hcr.ny.gov\n        *   **Rent Info Line:** 718-739-6400\n\n2.  **Check the DHCR Rent Stabilized Building Search Tool (Limited):**\n    *   DHCR has an online tool where you can search for buildings that are registered as rent stabilized. However, this tool is not always comprehensive or up-to-date for individual units, so requesting the specific rent history is usually better.\n\n### Things to Be Wary Of:\n\n*   **Don't rely solely on what your landlord tells you.** While some landlords are honest, others may misinform tenants about their rights.\n*   **A high rent doesn't automatically mean it's not stabilized.** Stabilized rents can still be high, especially in desirable areas or if the apartment has undergone legal improvements.\n\n**In summary, the \"easiest\" initial check is your building's age (pre-1974) and size (6+ units), followed by checking your lease for a Rent Stabilization Rider. However, the most accurate and definitive method is to request the rent history from DHCR.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am a housing law assistant and this information is for general guidance based on NYC law.

            "llama3": "Rent control regulations vary by jurisdiction, but here are some general guidelines to help you determine if your building might be under rent control:\n\n1. **Check the local laws**: Look up the rent control or stabilization laws for your city or county. These laws often apply to buildings constructed before a certain date (e.g., 1947) and/or to specific neighborhoods.\n2. **Age of the building**: In many places, older buildings are more likely to be under rent control. For example:\n\t* New York City's Rent Stabilization Law applies to buildings constructed between 1947 and 1974.\n\t* San Francisco's Rent Control Ordinance applies to buildings constructed before November 1979.\n3. **Type of building**: Certain types of buildings are more likely to be under rent control, such as:\n\t* Apartment buildings (especially older ones)\n\t* Tenement buildings\n\t* Buildings in historic districts or neighborhoods with designated rent control areas\n4. **Location**: Rent control laws often apply to specific neighborhoods or areas with high demand for housing.\n5. **Landlord-tenant agreements**: Review your lease agreement and any prior landlord-tenant agreements. If you've signed a new lease after the rent control period ended, your rent may not be controlled.\n6. **Contact local authorities**: Reach out to your local department of buildings, housing, or consumer affairs to ask if your building is subject to rent control regulations.\n\nSome popular online resources for checking rent control laws include:\n\n1. NYC's Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) Rent Stabilization Association: [www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/rent/stable.html](http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/rent/stable.html)\n2.

            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, rent control is still in effect and is governed by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1971 (ETPA). Rent control applies to certain residential buildings built before February 1, 1947, and to apartments where the tenant or their family has continuously resided since July 1, 1971, or earlier. These buildings must contain three or more apartments.\n\nOutside of New York City, rent control is not in effect.

The tenant must also have been living in the apartment continuously since before July 1, 1971, or be a family member of the original tenant.\n\n2. **Rent Increases**: Rent increases for rent-controlled apartments are determined by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board and are typically lower than those for rent-stabilized apartments.\n\n3. **Lease Renewal**: Tenants in rent-controlled apartments have strong protections against eviction and are entitled to lease renewals as long as they continue to live in the apartment and comply with the terms of their lease.\n\n4. **Successorship Rights**: Rent-controlled apartments have strong succession rights, allowing family members to take over the tenancy under certain conditions.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's always a good idea to consult the official resources provided by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or seek advice from a legal professional specializing in housing law.",

Rent stabilization applies to buildings built before January 1, 1974 (with some exceptions for newer buildings receiving tax abatements like J-51 or 421-a) and generally having six or more units.\n\nBoth rent control and rent stabilization are administered by the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR).",

These apartments are typically older buildings, mostly built before World War II.\n\nAs for where rent control is still in effect, here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **New York City**: The entire city has some form of rent regulation, with rent stabilization being more prevalent than rent control.\n\t* Rent-stabilized apartments make up about 50% of the city's rental stock (around 1 million units). These apartments are subject to annual rent increases and have protections against excessive rent hikes.\n\t* Rent-controlled apartments account for a smaller portion, around 20-30% of the city's rental stock (about 200,000 units), mostly found in older buildings built before 1947. These apartments are subject to more stringent regulations, with limited rent increases allowed.\n2. **Other areas**: While not as widespread, some surrounding counties and cities in New York State also have rent control or stabilization laws:\n\t* **Westchester County**: Some municipalities within Westchester County, such as Yonkers, Mount Vernon, and White Plains, have rent regulation laws.\n\t* **Long Island** (Nassau and Suffolk Counties): Some towns and villages on Long Island have their own rent control or stabilization laws.\n\t* **Hudson Valley** (Dutchess, Putnam, and Columbia Counties): A few municipalities in this region have rent regulation laws.\n\nTo confirm the specific regulations for a particular location, I recommend contacting local authorities, such as the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or the relevant municipality's housing department."

It will not typically state if it's rent controlled, as those are very specific historical tenancies.\n*   **DHCR Website:** You can check the rent history of your apartment on the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR) website.

            "llama3": "The answer depends on where you live. In the United States, rent control laws vary from state to state and even within cities or municipalities.\n\nIn New York City, for example, a rent-stabilized lease is triggered when a tenant has lived in an apartment continuously for at least one year. The rent can be increased annually based on a formula that takes into account increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To qualify for rent stabilization, the landlord must have registered the unit with the New York City Rent Guidelines Board by May 1st of each year.\n\nIn San Francisco, California, rent control applies to apartments occupied continuously since June 1979. The law limits annual rent increases to the greater of 2% or the CPI.\n\nIn Los Angeles, California, rent control applies to apartments occupied continuously since October 1980. Rent increases are limited to the CPI plus a percentage (currently 3%).\n\nIn other cities or states, the requirements may differ. For instance:\n\n* In Chicago, Illinois, rent control applies to apartments occupied continuously since August 1975.\n* In Washington, D.C., rent control applies to apartments occupied continuously since October 1985.\n\nTo determine if your apartment is rent controlled in your area, I recommend contacting your local housing authority or a tenant rights organization for specific information on the laws and regulations that apply to your situation."

Here's a breakdown of what happens:\n\n1. **Rent Control**: This applies to tenants who have lived in an apartment since before July 1, 1971, or who are successors to such tenants. The rent and eviction protections are more stringent under rent control.\n\n2. **Rent Stabilization**: When a rent-controlled tenant moves out, the apartment usually becomes rent-stabilized. Rent stabilization applies to apartments in buildings with six or more units built between February 1, 1947, and January 1, 1974. It also applies to apartments in buildings with three or more units built before February 1, 1947, that are not subject to rent control.\n\n3. **Vacancy Increase**: Upon the vacancy of a rent-controlled apartment, the landlord can increase the rent to the rent stabilization level, plus an additional vacancy increase. The vacancy increase is currently 16.5% for one-year leases and 20% for two-year leases.\n\n4. **New Tenant**: The new tenant will then be subject to the rules of rent stabilization, including different rent increase guidelines and succession rights.\n\nIt's always a good idea to consult with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) or a legal professional for advice tailored to your specific situation, as housing laws can be complex and subject to change.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "No, generally it does not stay rent controlled for the next tenant.\n\nIn New York City, rent control is a very specific and increasingly rare form of rent regulation. It primarily applies to tenants who have been in their apartments continuously since before July 1, 1971.\n\nWhen a rent-controlled apartment becomes vacant, it almost always converts to **rent stabilization** for the next tenant. This means that while the apartment will still be regulated, the rules governing rent increases, lease renewals, and tenant protections will shift from the stricter rent control system to the rent stabilization system.\n\n**The main exception to this rule is if a qualified family member has succession rights and takes over the apartment.** If a family member successfully claims succession rights (e.g., a spouse, child, or other defined family member who resided with the tenant for a specified period), the apartment will remain rent controlled for that successor tenant.\n\n**Key Difference:**\n*   **Rent Control:** Very strict limits on rent increases, often tied to operating costs or specific formulas set by the city.\n*   **Rent Stabilization:** Rent increases are set annually by the Rent Guidelines Board, and tenants have rights to renewal leases.\n\n**In summary:** Unless a family member successfully claims succession rights, your rent-controlled apartment will almost certainly become rent stabilized once you move out.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Housing law can be complex. For specific advice regarding your situation, it's always best to consult with a housing attorney or tenant advocacy organization.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, rent control regulations apply to apartments that were subject to rent control on July 1, 1971. If you move out of a rent-controlled apartment, the new tenant is not automatically entitled to the same rent control benefits.\n\nWhen a rent-controlled apartment becomes vacant, it can be re-rented at a higher rent, known as the \"vacancy rate,\" which is usually significantly higher than the original rent controlled rate. This is because the rent controlled provision only applies to the original tenant and their household members.\n\nHowever, if the new tenant is also an eligible family (i.e., a family with income below 125% of the area median gross income), they may be entitled to rent stabilization instead. Rent stabilization is a less stringent regulation that limits annual rent increases to 7-10%.\n\nTo qualify for rent control or rent stabilization, the new tenant must apply and meet certain eligibility requirements. The New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) department administers these programs.\n\nHere are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Rent control only applies to original tenants**: As mentioned earlier, rent control benefits only extend to the original tenant who occupied the apartment on July 1, 1971.\n2. **Vacancy rate: A higher rent**: When a rent-controlled apartment becomes vacant, the new tenant is typically charged a vacancy rate, which is usually significantly higher than the original rent controlled rate.\n3. **Rent stabilization possible**: If the new tenant is an eligible family, they may be entitled to rent stabilization instead of rent control.\n4. **Eligibility requirements apply**: To qualify for rent control or rent stabilization, the new tenant must meet certain eligibility requirements, such as income limits and household size.\n\nIt's essential to note that these regulations can be complex, and there may be exceptions or additional rules applying to specific situations. If you're considering moving out of a rent-controlled apartment in New York City, it's recommended to consult with a qualified real estate attorney or housing expert to understand your rights and obligations under the relevant laws and regulations."

These annual increases continue until the current rent reaches the established MBR.\n4.  **Reaching the MBR:** Once the actual rent reaches the MBR, it stays at that level until a new, higher MBR is established in the next two-year cycle, and the landlord can again apply the annual percentage increases towards that new MBR.\n\nIt's important to distinguish this from rent-stabilized apartments, where the Rent Guidelines Board sets annual percentage increases for lease renewals directly.

The building has **6 or more residential units**, and  \n2. It was built **before January 1, 1974**, and  \n3.

Your building was built in 1960, which falls well within this timeframe. (The original Rent Stabilization Law applied to buildings built before June 30, 1971, but the date was later extended to 1974 for certain purposes, and 1974 is the commonly cited cutoff for general applicability).\n2.  **Number of Units:** The Rent Stabilization Law applies to buildings with **six or more units**.

Contact the NYC Housing Preservation & Development (HPD) and/or the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB): They can provide information on whether your building has a rent-stabilization registration (RSR) number, which indicates that at least one apartment in the building is rent-stabilized.\nc.

Tenants in pre\u20111947 buildings who have continuously occupied the same apartment since before July 1, 1971 may instead be rent\u2011controlled (a separate, older form of regulation). Because you moved in after 1971, you would not qualify as rent\u2011controlled based on that cutoff.\n\nExceptions where a unit in a pre\u20111947 building can be rent\u2011stabilized:\n- The owner receives a government tax benefit or subsidy (for example certain J\u201151 or 421\u2011a/other regulatory programs) that requires stabilization for the term of the benefit.\n- The building or unit is subject to a regulatory agreement or other legal instrument putting it under rent stabilization.\n- The unit was formerly rent\u2011controlled and was converted to rent stabilization under prior law or registration practice (this is less common but possible depending on the building\u2019s history).\n\nWhat to do if you\u2019re unsure / how to check:\n- Request a Rent History for your apartment from New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). The rent history will show whether the unit has been registered as rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled and the legal regulated rent back through the years.\n- Ask the landlord for the building\u2019s registration status and any documents showing tax benefits or regulatory agreements.\n- Contact HCR (formerly DHCR) or a local tenant advice organization for help interpreting the rent history or filing a complaint if you think your apartment is improperly deregulated.\n- If needed, consult a housing attorney or tenant advocacy group.\n\nIf you want, tell me the building\u2019s address or what the landlord has said about regulation, and I can suggest the exact steps and forms to request a rent history.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: maybe, but not automatically. Being in a pre\u20111947 building and moving in after 1971 does not by itself mean your apartment is rent stabilized.\n\nWhat determines stabilization\n- In NYC, most rent stabilization applies to buildings that meet certain criteria (historically: at least 6 units, built before 1974, and that benefited from a tax or regulatory program such as J\u201151 or 421\u2011a). If a building qualifies, most or all of its units are rent stabilized.\n- It\u2019s not about the construction year alone or the move\u2011in date. A pre\u20111947 building can be rent stabilized if it\u2019s a \u201ccovered building\u201d under the Rent Stabilization Law and has a status of stabilization (often tied to tax benefits or prior regulations that remain in effect).\n- Also, some units in older buildings were stabilized under older rules (old law) and may still be stabilized, while others may not be.\n\nHow to check your status\n- DHCR (New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal) has an online lookup to see if a building is stabilized. You can search by address to see if the building is listed as stabilized or exempt.\n- Look at your lease. If it says the unit is rent stabilized, or if there is a Rent Stabilization rider, that\u2019s a strong indicator.\n- Ask your landlord for the building\u2019s Rent Registration (RH or RSC filing) or for any documentation showing stabilization status and any MCI (major capital improvement) increases.\n- If you\u2019re unsure or the landlord disputes stabilization, consider contacting a tenants\u2019 rights group or a housing lawyer for help with verification.\n\nWhat if it is stabilized vs. not stabilized\n- If stabilized: your rent is subject to the Rent Guidelines Board increases (and MCIs, if applicable). You have lease renewal rights and protections against unreasonable eviction. Changes in stabilization status are governed by state and city rules, with recent protections limiting deregulation in many cases.\n- If not stabilized: the unit is likely subject to market rents (though there can be other protections or old\u2011law stabilization in some cases). It\u2019s still worth confirming the specific status so you know what your rights are.\n\nIf you want, share the address and I can outline what the official status likely is and point you to the exact DHCR resource to verify.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, an apartment in a pre-1947 NYC building that you moved into after 1971 **can generally be rent stabilized**, but there are crucial factors that determine if it *actually is*.\n\nHere's why and what to consider:\n\n1.  **Building Age:** Buildings built before January 1, 1974, are generally subject to rent stabilization if they meet other criteria. Your \"pre-1947\" building easily meets this age requirement. Many pre-1947 buildings were initially subject to **rent control**.\n\n2.  **Vacancy After 1971:** When a rent-controlled apartment became vacant *after* June 30, 1971, it generally transitioned from rent control to **rent stabilization**. Since you moved in after 1971, it's highly likely that if the apartment was previously rent-controlled, it became rent stabilized upon the vacancy that allowed you to move in (or a prior vacancy).\n\n**However, several critical factors could mean it is NOT rent stabilized:**\n\n*   **Number of Units:** The most common reason an apartment in an older building is *not* stabilized is if the building has **fewer than 6 residential units**. If your building has 1-5 units, it is generally exempt from rent stabilization (unless it's a specific type of loft building or has other unique circumstances).\n*   **Prior Deregulation (Pre-HSTPA 2019):** Before the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) of 2019, apartments could be deregulated under certain conditions:\n    *   **High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation:** If the rent reached a certain threshold (e.g., $2,775 in 2019) upon vacancy, the apartment could be deregulated.\n    *   **High-Rent/High-Income Deregulation:** If the rent was above the threshold *and* the tenants' income exceeded a certain amount, the apartment could be deregulated.\n    *   **The HSTPA of 2019 eliminated these deregulation mechanisms.** However, if your apartment was deregulated *before* June 14, 2019, it generally remains deregulated.\n*   **Co-op/Condo Conversion:** If the building was converted to a co-op or condo and your specific apartment was sold to an owner, it is no longer rent stabilized. If it was converted but your apartment remained a rental unit and was never sold, it could still be stabilized.\n*   **Substantial Rehabilitation:** In rare cases, a building might have undergone such a significant gut renovation that it qualified for an exemption from stabilization, but this is less common for individual units in older buildings that were already subject to rent control.\n*   **Other Exemptions:** There are other, less common exemptions (e.g., certain non-profit ownership, temporary use).\n\n**How to find out for sure:**\n\nThe most definitive way to determine if your apartment is rent stabilized is to:\n\n1.  **Request your apartment's rent history from the NYS Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR).** This is the state agency that oversees rent stabilization. You can submit a \"Tenant's Request for a Copy of Rent History\" form (RA-89). This history will show if the apartment was ever registered as rent stabilized and its legal regulated rent.\n2.  **Check your lease.** A rent-stabilized lease should include a rent stabilization rider.\n3.  **Consult a housing attorney.** If you have any doubts or difficulty obtaining information, an attorney specializing in NYC housing law can help you investigate your apartment's status.\n\nIn summary, your apartment *could very well be* rent stabilized given the building age and your move-in date, but the number of units in the building and whether it was deregulated prior to 2019 are critical factors to confirm.",
            "llama3": "A great question about NYC's legendary rental market!\n\nIn general, yes, an apartment in a pre-1947 NYC building that was occupied after 1971 can be rent-stabilized. Here's why:\n\nPrior to 1969, many older NYC buildings were not subject to rent regulation, as the Rent Control Law of 1920 only applied to buildings built before 1920. Then, in 1969, the New York State Legislature passed the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL), which aimed to regulate rents and provide more protections for tenants.\n\nThe RSL established a system where apartments that were occupied after June 30, 1971, could be rent-stabilized if they met certain conditions. These conditions included:\n\n1. The building was constructed before January 15, 1947.\n2. The apartment was occupied by the same tenant or their spouse/children (or other household members) after June 30, 1971.\n\nIf your apartment meets these criteria, it is likely rent-stabilized. Rent stabilization means that the landlord must follow certain rules and regulations when setting rent increases, including:\n\n* Providing a written notice of rent increase at least 30 days before the change.\n* Limiting annual rent increases to a certain percentage (currently up to 2%).\n* Allowing tenants to renew their lease or sublease the apartment.\n\nKeep in mind that there may be exceptions and nuances depending on specific circumstances, such as:\n\n* If you've had multiple owners or landlords since 1971, it's possible that your apartment is no longer rent-stabilized.\n* Some buildings may have been exempt from rent stabilization due to special circumstances, like being used for a commercial purpose.\n\nTo confirm whether your apartment is indeed rent-stabilized, I recommend:\n\n1. Reviewing your lease agreement or any previous leases you've signed.\n2. Contacting the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) or the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) to inquire about the status of your building and apartment.\n\nBy understanding whether your apartment is rent-stabilized, you'll be better equipped to navigate the ever-changing NYC rental landscape!"

The unit remains subject to the Rent Stabilization Code unless there is some separate, lawful basis for deregulation (for example, the building is no longer covered by rent stabilization or the unit was lawfully deregulated before current law changes).\n- \u201cHigh\u2011rent/high\u2011income\u201d (luxury) deregulation used to be possible in some cases, but the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 eliminated that route. You cannot lose stabilization today just because the rent is high or the apartment becomes empty.\n- Landlords can lawfully raise the rent for a new tenant using the permitted vacancy increase and other lawful increases (IAI, MCI, etc.). But those increases do not by themselves remove rent\u2011stabilized status under current law.\n- If a landlord claims the apartment is no longer rent\u2011stabilized, they should be able to prove a lawful basis (for example, documentation showing the building is not covered). Mere vacancy is not proof.\n\nWhat you can do\n- Request the apartment\u2019s rent history/registration from NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)/Office of Rent Administration (formerly DHCR). That will show whether the unit is registered as rent\u2011stabilized and the legal regulated rent.\n- Ask the landlord for the registration number and a copy of the most recent rent registration and any stabilization rider.\n- If the landlord is trying to rent the unit at market rate or claims it\u2019s deregulated without documentation, contact HCR to file a complaint, or get help from a tenant legal services organization (Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, or a tenant organization).\n- If you are in the unit and the landlord served an eviction notice or is refusing to recognize stabilization, consult a tenant attorney or a tenant advocacy group right away.\n\nIf you want, tell me (1) whether you\u2019re the departing tenant or a prospective new tenant, and (2) the landlord\u2019s claim or paperwork \u2014 I can suggest the exact documents to request and next steps.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: possibly, but not automatically. A rent-stabilized unit can become deregulated when it becomes vacant if the unit\u2019s last legal rent is high enough under NYC/NY state rules. Whether that applies depends on several details (the building\u2019s size, the last stabilized rent, and the current deregulation thresholds, which are updated each year).\n\nWhat generally matters\n- Vacancy deregulation rule: In buildings with enough units (historically, six or more), a unit can leave rent stabilization when it becomes vacant if the unit\u2019s legal rent at the time of vacancy is above the statutory threshold. The threshold is set annually.\n- The unit\u2019s status: If the last rent was below the threshold, it remains stabilized when a new tenant moves in (or stays stabilized if the landlord keeps it stabilized).\n- Building type: In smaller buildings (fewer than six units) there are different rules about stabilization and deregulation; many small buildings are exempt from rent stabilization, depending on the time and building type.\n- Deregulation usually requires a DHCR filing: the landlord must pursue deregulation with the state agency, and the unit would be deregulated only if allowed by DHCR.\n\nImportant caveats\n- The exact threshold amount changes each year.

However, this provision was repealed as of June 14, 2019. Therefore, as of that date, high rent/vacancy deregulation is no longer possible.\n\n2. **Deregulation Due to Major Capital Improvements (MCIs) and Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs)**: Landlords can apply for rent increases based on MCIs and IAIs, which can eventually lead to deregulation if the rent reaches the threshold set by law. However, the 2019 rent laws also made it more difficult for landlords to use MCIs and IAIs to increase rents significantly.\n\n3. **Deregulation Due to Luxury Deregulation**: This provision allowed landlords to deregulate apartments if the tenant's income exceeded certain thresholds for four consecutive years. However, this provision was also repealed as of June 14, 2019.\n\nGiven these changes, as of the 2019 rent laws, a rent-stabilized apartment generally cannot be deregulated simply because it becomes vacant.

This often pushed rents above the deregulation threshold. The HSTPA eliminated this bonus.\n2.  **Elimination of High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation:** Prior to HSTPA, if an apartment became vacant and its legal regulated rent (often after a vacancy bonus) exceeded a certain threshold (e.g., $2,774.76 in 2019), it could be deregulated. The HSTPA abolished this mechanism entirely.\n3.  **Elimination of Luxury Deregulation:** The HSTPA also eliminated the ability to deregulate apartments based on high rent *and* high tenant income.\n\n**What this means for a vacant rent-stabilized apartment:**\n\n*   **It remains rent-stabilized.** Even when empty, the apartment retains its rent-stabilized status.\n*   **Rent Increases are Limited:** While the apartment is vacant, the landlord can still apply for rent increases based on:\n    *   **Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs):** If the landlord makes significant, qualifying improvements to the apartment while it's vacant, they can apply to increase the rent by a certain percentage of the cost of those improvements. However, there are caps on how much IAIs can increase the rent and how often they can be applied.\n    *   **Major Capital Improvements (MCIs):** If the building undergoes significant system-wide improvements (e.g., new roof, boiler), the landlord can apply for an MCI increase that affects all tenants in the building.\n    *   **Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) Increases:** The annual increases set by the RGB still apply.\n\n**In summary:** The days of a landlord simply waiting for an apartment to become vacant to deregulate it are over in NYC. The apartment will remain rent-stabilized, and any rent increases must follow the rules set by the Rent Guidelines Board and DHCR for IAIs and MCIs.\n\nIf you encounter a situation where a landlord claims a vacant apartment has been deregulated, you should verify its rent history with the **NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)**.",

Before 2019 landlords could in some cases deregulate a unit if the legal regulated rent and household income exceeded certain thresholds. That is no longer allowed for rent\u2011stabilized apartments.\n\nWhat this means for you\n- If your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized, your landlord may not deregulate it just because the rent or your income is above some level.\n- Landlords who try to claim decontrol on that basis are relying on an obsolete rule; you can challenge such attempts.\n\nImportant caveats\n- You should first confirm whether your apartment is actually rent\u2011stabilized (or rent\u2011controlled). Different rules apply to rent\u2011controlled units and to units that were never covered by the Rent Stabilization Law (for example, certain newer buildings or small owner\u2011occupied buildings). A landlord could try other legal means to remove a unit from coverage (for example, converting the building under a lawful condo/co\u2011op conversion, or asserting the building is not covered), but income/rent alone isn\u2019t a lawful basis now.\n- If a landlord pressures you for your income information claiming it\u2019s needed to deregulate, you do not have to provide it for that purpose.\n\nWhat you can do\n1. Don\u2019t sign anything that says your unit is deregulated or that you waive rights.\n2. Ask the landlord in writing to state the legal basis for deregulation and to provide the unit\u2019s rent history and the building\u2019s registration.\n3. Get the rent history / registration from New York State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR). That will show whether the unit is registered as stabilized and prior rent history.\n4. If the landlord is attempting an improper deregulation, file a complaint with HCR (formerly DHCR) and/or consult a tenant attorney or a tenant legal services organization (Legal Aid, NYC Housing Court Answers, Met Council on Housing, etc.). You can also call 311 for NYC tenant resources.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- whether your lease says \u201crent\u2011stabilized\u201d or lists a renewal guideline,\n- the building address and when it was built (if you know),\n- what the landlord told you or gave you in writing \u2014\n\nand I can suggest specific next steps and where to file a complaint.",

Also, some units may have preferential rents or other arrangements that affect how deregulation thresholds are applied, which can be technically complex.\n\nWhat you should do next\n\n- Find out your unit\u2019s exact status:\n  - Is the apartment currently rent-stabilized or rent-controlled, or is it market-rate?\n  - What was the last approved rent and what is the current \u201clegal rent\u201d for the unit?

            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, whether your occupied apartment can be deregulated depends on several factors, including the rent level and your income. Here are some key points to consider based on NYC housing laws:\n\n1. **Rent Level**: For an apartment to be subject to rent regulation (either rent control or rent stabilization), the rent must be below a certain threshold. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, for rent stabilization, the rent must be $2,774.76 or less (this amount can change annually). If your rent exceeds this threshold, the apartment may be eligible for deregulation.\n\n2. **Income**: For rent-controlled apartments, the income of the tenant is a crucial factor. If the tenant's income exceeds a certain level (currently $200,000 for two consecutive years), the apartment can be deregulated after the tenant moves out. However, for rent-stabilized apartments, income is generally not a factor in determining deregulation.\n\n3. **High-Rent and High-Income Deregulation**: Previously, apartments could be deregulated if the legal regulated rent reached a certain threshold ($2,774.76 as of 2023) and the tenant's income exceeded $200,000 for two consecutive years. However, the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 eliminated high-rent and high-income deregulation for most tenants.\n\n4. **Vacancy Deregulation**: Even if your apartment is currently regulated, it could potentially be deregulated when it becomes vacant, depending on the rent level at that time.\n\n5. **J-51 and 421-a Tax Exemptions**: If your building has J-51 or 421-a tax exemptions, the apartments may be subject to different rules regarding deregulation.\n\nIt's important to note that housing laws can change, and specific circumstances can affect whether an apartment can be deregulated. If you have concerns about your apartment being deregulated, it's advisable to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant advocacy organization for advice tailored to your situation.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, you can also contact the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or the New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD).",

This meant that if a rent-stabilized apartment's rent reached a certain threshold (the \"high-rent vacancy\" threshold) AND the tenant's household income exceeded a certain threshold for two consecutive years, the landlord could petition DHCR to deregulate the apartment, even if it was occupied.\n    *   **The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA) completely repealed these provisions.** As of June 14, 2019, luxury decontrol (high-rent/high-income deregulation) is no longer permitted in New York State.\n\n2.  **What This Means for You:**\n    *   If your apartment is currently rent-stabilized, it will remain rent-stabilized regardless of how high your rent goes or how much income you earn, as long as you remain in occupancy.\n    *   Your landlord cannot initiate a process to deregulate your apartment based on your rent level or income.\n\n**Important Caveat:**\n\n*   If a final order of deregulation based on high-rent/high-income was issued by DHCR *before* June 14, 2019, that apartment would remain deregulated.

In particular:\n\n- **High-rent vacancy and high-income deregulation** were abolished as of June 14, 2019.  \n- Landlords can no longer deregulate stabilized apartments simply because:\n  - The legal rent is above a certain threshold, or  \n  - The tenant\u2019s income is above a threshold, or  \n  - The apartment becomes vacant and improvements are made.\n\nIf your landlord is claiming your unit is \u201cderegulated,\u201d that claim itself may be **incorrect or illegal**, depending on how and when they say deregulation happened.\n\nBefore talking about market rent, you should confirm:\n- Whether your unit is/was rent-stabilized or rent-controlled.\n- The **registered rent history** with DHCR (NYS Homes and Community Renewal).\n- On what basis the landlord says the unit is now deregulated.\n\nYou can request your rent history from DHCR:\n- Online: https://hcr.ny.gov\n- By phone: (718) 739-6400\n- Or in person at a borough rent office.\n\n### 2. If the apartment is **truly** deregulated\nIf your apartment is lawfully not subject to rent regulation (for example, a free-market unit that never was stabilized, or a unit that was permanently exempt long ago and in a valid way):\n\n- The landlord can offer a **market-rate rent** for a new lease.  \n- They are not bound by rent guidelines or legal regulated rent, because those only apply to regulated apartments.\n\nHowever, even in a market-rate unit, some rules still apply:\n- **Rent increases mid-lease** are not allowed unless specifically permitted by the lease and consistent with general contract law.\n- Many HSTPA protections apply to *all* residential tenancies, including:\n  - Limits on late fees.\n  - Notice requirements for non-renewal or rent increases over 5% (RPL \u00a7226-c).\n  - Security deposit rules (max one month, condition reports, etc.).\n\n### 3. If you are an **existing tenant** in a regulated unit\nIf your unit is still rent-stabilized, the landlord:\n\n- Cannot just \u201cderegulate\u201d during your tenancy (with the post-2019 law).\n- Must offer renewal leases on the DHCR form at lawful regulated rents set by Rent Guidelines Board orders, **not** market-rate rents.\n\nIf they refuse to offer a proper renewal or try to jump you to \u201cmarket,\u201d you can:\n- File a rent overcharge / lease complaint with DHCR.\n- Or consider a rent-stabilization claim in Housing Court (ideally with an attorney).\n\n### 4. If the landlord claims deregulation at vacancy\nIf you moved in **after 2019**, and the landlord told you it\u2019s a \u201cmarket-rate\u201d apartment but the building looks like it should be rent-stabilized (e.g., 6+ units in a 1940s building, with no obvious exemptions), it\u2019s possible:\n\n- The apartment is *illegally* treated as deregulated.\n- You may actually be a **rent-stabilized tenant** with the right to a regulated rent and renewals.\n\nIn that case, the landlord\u2019s \u201cmarket-rate\u201d rent might be an **overcharge**, and you can:\n- Pull rent history from DHCR.\n- Talk to a tenant lawyer or a tenant advocacy group.\n- Potentially file an overcharge complaint.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- When your building was built,\n- How many units it has,\n- Whether you have a rent history from DHCR, and\n- What the landlord is saying about deregulation,\n\nI can give more precise guidance on whether they\u2019re allowed to offer you a market-rate rent in your specific situation.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Yes \u2014 but only if the unit is actually no longer rent\u2011regulated. If your apartment truly loses its regulated status, the landlord can charge a market rent. In practice, though, most rent-stabilized apartments in NYC cannot be taken out of stabilization now, so deregulation is uncommon.\n\nKey points\n\n- What \u201cderegulated\u201d means: it means the unit is no longer subject to rent\u2011stabilization (or rent\u2011control) rules. A deregulated apartment can be rented at any lawful market rate and is not covered by the Rent Guidelines Board increases or renewal\u2011lease protections.\n\n- Changes since 2019: The 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act removed the main paths that previously allowed many rent\u2011stabilized apartments to be deregulated on vacancy or for \u201chigh\u2011rent/high\u2011income.\u201d Because of that law, most stabilized units in buildings covered by rent stabilization (generally buildings with six or more units built before 1974 or that received tax benefits) remain regulated even after a vacancy.\n\n- When a landlord may charge market rate: If the apartment was never regulated, was lawfully deregulated before the 2019 changes, or otherwise legitimately lost its regulated status, the landlord may offer market rent to the next tenant (or to you if no stabilization protection applies). For rent\u2011controlled units the rules are different and they are rarely deregulated.\n\nWhat you should do if your landlord says the unit is deregulated\n\n1. Ask for proof in writing. Request the landlord\u2019s basis for deregulation and a rent history/registration for the apartment.  \n2. Check public records and registrations. You can check rent\u2011stabilization registration records and rent history through state/city resources (DHCR/HCR and the NYC Rent Guidelines Board/HPD resources or by calling 311) to see if the unit is listed as stabilized and what the lawful rent history is.  \n3. Don\u2019t stop paying rent. If you currently pay a stabilized rent, continue to pay the amount you believe is due (or seek legal advice on placing rent in escrow) while you challenge the claim.  \n4. Challenge an improper deregulation. If you believe the landlord is wrong, you can file a complaint with NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or seek help from a tenant attorney or Legal Aid/tenant advocacy groups.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether your unit is rent\u2011stabilized now (do you have a lease marked \u201cRent Stabilized\u201d? is the building 6+ units and pre\u20111974?) and whether the landlord has given you written notice that it\u2019s deregulated \u2014 I can tell you the likely rule that applies and the next steps.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: Yes. In NYC, when a rent-stabilized unit becomes deregulated (which usually happens when the unit becomes vacant and the legal rent is high enough under the applicable rules), the unit leaves the rent-stabilization system and can be rented at market rate to the next tenant. If you stay in the unit after deregulation, any new lease would typically be at a non-stabilized, market-rate rent.\n\nA few important details:\n- Deregulation normally occurs at vacancy. An occupied unit is not usually deregulated while someone is living there.\n- After deregulation, the landlord can offer a new lease to the next tenant at market rate. If you are the current tenant and the unit deregulates (because you vacate and a new tenant moves in), you would not be guaranteed a stabilized lease anymore.\n- If you remain in the unit after it deregulates (i.e., you and the landlord agree to a new lease), you would be under a market-rate lease, not a rent-stabilized one.\n\nWhat to do next:\n- If you\u2019re in a deregulated unit or expect deregulation, ask the landlord for a written deregulation notice and the rent history/terms for the next tenancy.\n- Consider consulting a tenants\u2019 attorney or a local housing advisor to review any proposed lease and your rights, as rules and thresholds can change and can depend on the date.\n- You can also check resources from NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the NYC Rent Guidelines Board for current rules and protections.\n\nIf you want, tell me your lease status (current lease expiration, whether the unit is currently stabilized, etc.), and I can tailor the guidance to your situation.",
            "Llama 4 Scout": "According to NYC's Rent Stabilization Law, if your unit gets deregulated, your landlord can offer you a lease renewal at a market-rate rent, but only if they follow the proper procedures.\n\nSpecifically, when a unit is deregulated, the landlord must still offer the tenant a lease renewal, but the rent can be set at market rate. However, the landlord must provide the tenant with a \"Offer of a Lease\" (also known as a \"Lease Option\") that meets specific requirements.\n\nThe Offer of a Lease must:\n\n1. Be in writing\n2. Specify the proposed rent\n3. Inform the tenant of their right to a 60-day period to accept or reject the offer\n4. Be served on the tenant at least 60 days before the end of the current lease term\n\nIf the landlord fails to provide a proper Offer of a Lease, the tenant may be able to challenge the market-rate rent or even remain in the unit at the previous rent.\n\nKeep in mind that NYC's rent laws are complex, and specific circumstances may affect the landlord's ability to offer a market-rate rent. It's always a good idea to consult with a housing law expert or a qualified attorney to ensure you understand your rights and options.",
            "GPT 4.1": "Yes, if your unit is lawfully deregulated, your landlord can offer you a market-rate rent.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Deregulation** means your apartment is no longer subject to rent stabilization or rent control laws.\n- Once deregulated, the landlord is not bound by the legal rent guidelines and can set the rent at whatever amount the market will bear.\n- This typically happens through **high-rent vacancy deregulation** (no longer allowed for most units after the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act), **high-income deregulation** (also eliminated in 2019), or if the building becomes exempt for another legal reason (such as substantial rehabilitation or owner occupancy in certain cases).\n\n**Important:**  \n- If you believe your unit was improperly deregulated, you can file a complaint with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).\n- If you have a lease, the landlord cannot raise your rent until the lease expires, even if the unit is deregulated during your tenancy.\n\n**Summary:**  \nIf your unit is lawfully deregulated, the landlord can offer you a market-rate rent. If you suspect the deregulation was not legal, seek legal advice or contact DHCR.",
            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, the process of deregulation and the subsequent rent that a landlord can offer depends on several factors, primarily related to the type of rent regulation your unit is subject to. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Rent-Stabilized Units**: If your unit is rent-stabilized, it can only be deregulated under specific conditions. One of the main ways a rent-stabilized unit can be deregulated is if the legal regulated rent reaches a certain threshold (currently $2,774.76 per month as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023) and the unit is vacant. Even if the unit is deregulated, the landlord must still follow the proper legal procedures and cannot arbitrarily increase the rent to market rate without a vacancy.\n\n2. **Rent-Controlled Units**: Rent-controlled units have more stringent regulations. These units can only be deregulated if the tenant vacates the unit and the rent reaches a certain threshold. The landlord cannot offer market-rate rent to a sitting tenant in a rent-controlled unit.\n\n3. **High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation**: For rent-stabilized units, if the legal regulated rent reaches the deregulation threshold and the unit becomes vacant, the landlord can then offer the unit at market rate. However, this process must be done in compliance with all legal requirements, including proper notice and documentation.\n\n4. **High-Income Deregulation**: Previously, units could be deregulated if the tenant's income exceeded a certain threshold for a number of years. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, this method of deregulation has been largely eliminated by recent legislation.\n\nIf your unit is deregulated, the landlord can offer a market-rate rent, but they must follow all legal procedures and provide proper notice. It's crucial to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant advocacy group to understand your specific situation and rights.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, you should refer to the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or consult with a legal professional.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "This is a critical question, and the answer depends heavily on **when** and **how** your unit might deregulate, especially in light of the **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown based on NYC law:\n\n1.  **The Impact of HSTPA (June 14, 2019):**\n    *   The HSTPA **eliminated most pathways for deregulation** for rent-stabilized units.\n    *   **High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation** (where a unit became deregulated if the rent reached a certain threshold and the unit became vacant) was abolished.\n    *   **High-Rent High-Income Deregulation** (where a unit could be deregulated if the rent was high and the tenants' income exceeded a certain threshold) was also abolished.\n    *   This means that for the vast majority of units that were rent-stabilized *before* HSTPA, they **cannot deregulate** under these mechanisms anymore. They remain rent-stabilized indefinitely, regardless of rent level or tenant income.\n\n2.  **Remaining Deregulation Pathways (and what happens then):**\n    While most deregulation was stopped, a few specific scenarios still exist:\n\n    *   **Expiration of Tax Abatements (J-51 or 421-a):**\n        *   Some buildings receive tax abatements (like J-51 for renovations or 421-a for new construction) in exchange for placing units under rent stabilization for a *temporary* period.\n        *   **If your unit's rent stabilization is solely due to one of these abatements, and that abatement period officially expires, then yes, the unit can deregulate.**\n        *   **In this specific scenario, once the unit is legally deregulated, the landlord *can* then offer you a market-rate rent.** You would lose your rent stabilization protections, and future rent increases would not be governed by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n\n    *   **Co-op/Condo Conversion (with specific conditions):**\n        *   If a building converts to a co-op or condo, existing rent-stabilized tenants often retain their stabilization rights. However, new tenants moving into units that become vacant *after* the conversion might not be rent-stabilized. This is more about the unit's status upon vacancy rather than a \"deregulation\" of an occupied unit.\n\n    *   **Owner Occupancy (for buildings with fewer than 6 units):**\n        *   If a building has fewer than six units and the owner moves into one of the units, certain other units in the building *may* become exempt from rent stabilization. This is a specific exemption, not a general deregulation.\n\n3.  **What if your landlord *claims* your unit is deregulated but it shouldn't be?**\n    *   This is a common issue. Landlords sometimes incorrectly claim a unit is deregulated, especially if it was vacant for a period or if they performed renovations.\n    *   **Do NOT assume your unit is deregulated just because your landlord says so.**\n    *   **Always check your unit's rent history** with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR). You can request a rent history for your apartment, which will show if it was ever registered as rent-stabilized and what the legal regulated rent was.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **For the vast majority of previously rent-stabilized units in NYC, deregulation is no longer possible due to HSTPA.** If your unit is still rent-stabilized, your landlord **cannot** offer you a market-rate rent; they must adhere to Rent Guidelines Board increases.\n*   **The primary exception where a unit *can* still deregulate is upon the expiration of a temporary tax abatement (like J-51 or 421-a). If this happens, then yes, your landlord can offer you a market-rate rent.**\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1.  **Request your rent history from DHCR.** This is the most crucial first step to understand your unit's status.\n2.  **If your landlord claims your unit is deregulated, do not sign anything immediately.**\n3.  **Seek legal advice from a housing attorney or tenant advocacy group.** They can review your specific situation, your rent history, and any documents from your landlord to determine if the deregulation claim is legitimate.",
            "llama3": "A great question about tenant protection laws!\n\nWhen a rental unit becomes deregulated (also known as \"vacancy decontrol\" or \"rent regulation repeal\"), it means that the local government's rent control or stabilization laws no longer apply to that specific unit. This often happens when a rent-stabilized lease expires, and the landlord decides not to renew the rent-stabilization agreement.\n\nIn New York City, for example, if your rent-stabilized apartment becomes deregulated, the landlord may offer you a market-rate rent (MRP) instead of continuing to charge you the original stabilized rent. This means they can raise the rent to whatever rate they think the open market would bear, as long as it's not higher than the maximum allowed under city law.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Notice requirements**: If your landlord wants to offer you a market-rate rent, they must provide you with written notice at least 60 days before the stabilized lease expires.\n2. **Renewal options**: You may still have the option to renew your lease under the original rent-stabilization agreement if you meet certain criteria, such as occupying the unit continuously for a specified period or having a rent-regulated tenant in the building.\n3. **MRP caps**: Even with market-rate rent, there are caps on how much the landlord can increase the rent. In NYC, the maximum MRP is typically limited to 7% above the previous year's rent, plus changes to the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) formula.\n4. **Protections for certain tenants**: If you're a senior citizen or have a disability, you may be eligible for additional protections under local laws, such as continued rent stabilization or more generous renewal options.\n\nTo summarize: if your unit becomes deregulated, your landlord can offer you a market-rate rent, but they must follow specific notice and procedural requirements. You should review your lease and consult with a tenant rights organization or attorney to understand your specific situation and the protections available to you."

These come from state law plus HPD (City\u2011supervised) or HCR (state\u2011supervised) rules, and the building\u2019s own approved plan.\n\nKey categories:\n\n1. **Income limits**\n   - You must be within the income limits for that development, which depend on:\n     - Program type (HPD vs HCR; sometimes federal subsidies like Section 8)\n     - Apartment size (number of rooms/bedrooms)\n     - Household size (number of people)\n   - Limits are usually expressed as a dollar cap on \u201cannual household income\u201d for initial admission and for continued occupancy.\n   - \u201cIncome\u201d generally includes:\n     - Wages, tips, overtime, bonuses, self\u2011employment income\n     - Social Security, SSI, SSDI, pensions, annuities\n     - Unemployment, workers\u2019 comp\n     - Regular cash contributions from family/friends\n     - Some assets\u2019 imputed income\n   - Buildings must verify income using tax returns, pay stubs, benefit letters, etc.\n\n2. **Household composition & occupancy standards**\n   - The number of people in the household must match the approved occupancy standard for the apartment size.\n   - Each development has a written occupancy table approved by HPD or HCR (e.g., minimum and maximum number of people for a 1\u2011BR, 2\u2011BR, etc.).\n   - Everyone living there must be part of the authorized household (listed and approved). Adding household members generally requires management approval.\n\n3. **Primary residence requirement**\n   - The apartment must be your **primary residence**:\n     - You must actually live there most of the time.\n     - You can\u2019t maintain another main residence elsewhere.\n   - Extended absences (e.g., long stays elsewhere) may threaten eligibility unless approved and clearly temporary.\n   - Subletting is either prohibited or tightly restricted; unauthorized subletting is a basis for eviction and/or removal from the program.\n\n4. **Asset/ownership restrictions**\n   - You generally cannot:\n     - Own or have an interest in a residential home or apartment that could serve as a suitable residence.\n     - Have excessive assets inconsistent with the purpose of the program (details vary by development and supervising agency).\n   - Some developments have explicit asset caps or rules about recent property sales (e.g., you may be asked to explain proceeds from sale and how that affects eligibility).\n\n5. **Documentation & verification**\n   - To move in, and then periodically (usually every 1\u20133 years), tenants must:\n     - Complete income/household affidavits\n     - Provide proof of income, tax returns, ID, and household composition\n   - Failure to recertify or provide documentation can result in:\n     - Surcharges (higher rent)\n     - Loss of eligibility and potential eviction\n\n6. **Citizenship/immigration status**\n   - Mitchell\u2011Lama itself doesn\u2019t automatically require citizenship, but:\n     - If there is a **federal subsidy** (e.g., project\u2011based Section 8), HUD rules on eligible immigration status may apply.\n   - Management may ask for documentation to comply with federal subsidy requirements, if any.\n\n7. **Age / special categories (if applicable)**\n   - Some Mitchell\u2011Lama developments are designated for:\n     - Seniors (e.g., minimum age requirements)\n     - People with disabilities\n     - Specific populations (e.g., some union-sponsored housing)\n   - In those cases, at least one household member must meet the special category eligibility.\n\n8. **Good standing / other criteria**\n   - Applicants and tenants must:\n     - Not have significant outstanding rent arrears in prior subsidized housing (in some cases)\n     - Comply with the lease and development rules (house rules, no illegal activity, etc.)\n   - Serious violations can lead to termination or denial of succession rights.\n\n9. **Succession rights**\n   - Family members who want to succeed to a Mitchell\u2011Lama apartment must:\n     - Prove they are a qualifying family member under the rules, and\n     - Show they lived in the apartment as a primary residence for the required period (often 2 years, 1 year if over 62 or disabled, but there are nuances).\n   - They must also meet the income and occupancy requirements at the time they claim succession.\n\nBecause details differ between developments and supervising agencies, the exact eligibility rules for your building will be in:\n\n- The building\u2019s **admission and occupancy policies** approved by HPD or HCR; and  \n- HPD or HCR Mitchell\u2011Lama regulations.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether your building is **HPD\u2011supervised or HCR\u2011supervised**, and  \n- Your apartment size and household size,\n\nI can point you to the specific income/occupancy ranges and any particular rules that are likely to apply in your situation.",

Limits are set by New York State (Homes & Community Renewal, HCR) and vary by development, unit size, and are updated annually.  \n- Household/occupancy standards: household size must be appropriate for the unit (e.g., family size relative to number of bedrooms).  \n- Citizenship/immigration status: applicants generally must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or certain eligible immigrants.  \n- No disqualifying ownership: some developments screen out applicants who currently own other real property or homes.  \n- Background/verification: applicants are screened with income and asset verification, credit/rental history, and sometimes criminal background checks (subject to fair\u2011housing law limits).  \n- Local preferences: many developments give preferences (city/borough residents, municipal employees, veterans, mobility\u2011impaired applicants, current Mitchell\u2011Lama tenants, etc.). The exact preference rules depend on the building.\n\nDifferences for existing tenants\n- If you already live in a Mitchell\u2011Lama rental, you normally do not have to continuously re\u2011qualify on income to remain \u2014 your right to stay is governed by your lease and the development\u2019s regulatory agreement. However, certain subsidized units may require periodic income recertification.  \n- Shareholders in Mitchell\u2011Lama co\u2011ops who bought under program rules had to meet eligibility at purchase; resale of shares is usually subject to Mitchell\u2011Lama resale controls and buyer eligibility rules.\n\nImportant practical points\n- Rules vary by building and by whether it\u2019s a Mitchell\u2011Lama rental or co\u2011op. Some specifics (income caps, preference categories, occupancy rules, recertification requirements) are set in the project\u2019s regulatory documents.  \n- When a development prepays its mortgage or leaves the program, protections and eligibility rules can change \u2014 so watch for notices about prepayment/exit.  \n- If you\u2019re denied admission, asked to recertify, or face a dispute about eligibility, you can request the development\u2019s written policy and appeal rights.

The exact rules can vary by development because the sponsor and the state set the limits for each building, and they\u2019re recertified periodically.\n\nWhat tenants typically have to meet\n\n- Income limits (eligibility by income)\n  - Your household income must be within the limit set for your unit size (number of bedrooms) and the year. For most NYC Mitchell-Lama rentals, the typical cap is around 80% of the area median income (AMI), but the exact figure and the applicable unit-size tier can differ by development.\n  - Limits are published for each building and are updated annually. Your building\u2019s management or sponsor will provide the current numbers.\n\n- Primary residence requirement\n  - The unit must be your primary residence. Subletting is generally restricted and usually not allowed without the sponsor\u2019s approval.\n\n- Occupancy unit size\n  - Eligibility is tied to the unit size (e.g., 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom). The income limit is usually calculated based on the household size corresponding to the unit\u2019s bedrooms.\n\n- Documentation and screening\n  - You\u2019ll likely need to provide documentation such as proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns), employment verification, recent bank statements, photo ID, and information for all household members.\n  - Many buildings require consent to release information and may conduct a background/credit check, as well as review rental history.\n\n- Citizenship/immigration status\n  - Most Mitchell-Lama programs require applicants to be citizens or eligible non-citizens; specific rules can vary by sponsor.\n\n- Annual/periodic recertification\n  - Even after you\u2019re approved, you\u2019ll usually undergo annual or periodic income recertification to confirm continued eligibility. A rise in household income above the limit can affect your eligibility.\n\n- Subletting and ownership restrictions\n  - Subletting generally isn\u2019t allowed without approval.\n  - You typically cannot own another residence that would conflict with the primary-residence requirement, and there are various rules about ownership and occupancy that the sponsor enforces.\n\n- Additional building-specific rules\n  - Some developments have special preferences (e.g., veterans, seniors, local residents) or additional building policies.

Residency Requirements: There are no specific residency requirements to live in a Mitchell-Lama development, but preference may be given to New York City residents.\n\n5. No Overcrowding: The apartment must not be overcrowded according to New York City Housing Maintenance Code standards.\n\n6. No Outstanding Rent: Tenants must not have any outstanding rent arrears in other New York City or State-assisted housing.\n\nThese requirements may change, and it's best to verify with your landlord or the NYC Housing Development Corporation (HDC) for the most up-to-date information.",

These limits are based on the area median income (AMI) and vary depending on the size of the household. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the income limits are typically updated annually.\n\n2. **Household Size**: The size of the household must match the size of the apartment. For example, a one-bedroom apartment is typically suitable for a household of one or two people, while a two-bedroom apartment is suitable for a household of three or four people.\n\n3. **Residency**: Tenants must be legal residents of the United States. This means that tenants must be U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or have eligible immigration status.\n\n4. **Background Check**: Tenants must pass a background check, which includes a review of criminal history, credit history, and rental history. Certain criminal convictions or a history of evictions may disqualify an applicant.\n\n5. **Occupancy Standards**: Tenants must comply with the occupancy standards set by the Mitchell-Lama program. This includes limits on the number of people who can live in an apartment based on its size.\n\n6. **First-Time Homebuyer Status**: In some cases, tenants may need to certify that they have not owned a home in the past three years, depending on the specific rules of the development.\n\n7. **Other Requirements**: Tenants may need to meet additional requirements set by the specific Mitchell-Lama development, such as providing proof of employment or other documentation.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific eligibility requirements can vary slightly depending on the particular Mitchell-Lama development and any updates to the program's rules. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, tenants should contact the management office of their specific Mitchell-Lama development or the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR).\n\nAdditionally, tenants in Mitchell-Lama developments have certain rights and protections, including rent stabilization and the right to renew their lease, as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "As a housing law assistant, I can tell you that Mitchell-Lama developments in NYC are designed to provide affordable housing, and as such, they have specific eligibility requirements for tenants. These requirements are primarily set by the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) for city-supervised developments, or NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) for state-supervised ones.\n\nHere are the main eligibility requirements tenants typically have to meet:\n\n1.  **Income Limits (Minimum and Maximum):**\n    *   **Maximum Income:** This is the most critical requirement. Your household's total annual income must not exceed a certain percentage of the Area Median Income (AMI) for your household size. These limits vary significantly by development, apartment size, and are updated annually. They are designed to ensure that the housing remains affordable for those who need it.\n    *   **Minimum Income:** Most developments also have a minimum income requirement to ensure that tenants can afford the monthly carrying charges (for co-ops) or rent (for rentals) without undue hardship. This is often calculated as a multiple of the monthly housing cost (e.g., 2-3 times the rent/maintenance).\n    *   **Source:** These limits are set by HPD or HCR and are specific to each development.\n\n2.  **Household Composition and Size:**\n    *   There are rules about the number of occupants per apartment to prevent both overcrowding and under-utilization. For example:\n        *   A studio apartment might be for 1-2 people.\n        *   A one-bedroom might be for 1-2 people.\n        *   A two-bedroom might be for 2-4 people.\n    *   These rules ensure that apartments are allocated appropriately based on family size.\n\n3.  **Primary Residence:**\n    *   The Mitchell-Lama apartment must be your primary residence. You cannot own another residential property (house, condo, co-op) or use the Mitchell-Lama unit as a secondary home or investment property.\n    *   There are very limited exceptions, such as owning an uninhabitable property that is actively being sold, but these are rare and require specific approval from the supervising agency.\n\n4.  **Citizenship/Immigration Status:**\n    *   Generally, applicants must be U.S. citizens or have eligible immigration status.\n\n5.  **Application Process and Waiting Lists:**\n    *   To become a tenant, you must apply when a development's waiting list is open. Due to high demand, many Mitchell-Lama waiting lists are closed and only open periodically, often through a lottery system.\n    *   Applicants are typically screened for creditworthiness, rental history, and criminal background.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Development-Specific Rules:** It is crucial to understand that while these are general guidelines, each Mitchell-Lama development may have its own specific income limits, occupancy standards, and application procedures. You must consult the specific development's management office or the supervising agency (HPD or HCR) for the exact requirements.\n*   **Co-op vs. Rental:** Mitchell-Lama includes both rental buildings and co-operative buildings. While the initial eligibility requirements are similar, co-ops involve purchasing shares and becoming a shareholder, whereas rentals involve signing a lease.\n*   **Succession Rights:** These requirements apply to *initial* applicants. There are separate rules regarding \"succession rights\" which allow eligible family members to take over an apartment after a tenant of record vacates or passes away, provided they meet specific criteria (e.g., living in the apartment with the tenant for a certain period, meeting income limits).\n\nAlways consult the specific Mitchell-Lama development's management or HPD/HCR directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding eligibility.",

These limits vary depending on the development, location, and number of people in your household.\n2. **Family Size**: The size of your household will also impact eligibility. Typically, a Mitchell-Lama development sets a maximum family size, which is usually based on the number of bedrooms in the apartment.\n3. **Gross Income**: Your gross income (i.e., before taxes and deductions) must be below the established limits. This includes income from all household members, including wages, tips, commissions, unemployment benefits, and any other sources of income.\n4. **Credit History**: You'll need a decent credit history to demonstrate your ability to pay rent on time. This typically means having no recent evictions or outstanding debt related to previous rental agreements.\n5. **Citizenship/Residency**: To be eligible for a Mitchell-Lama apartment, you must be a U.S. citizen, a lawful permanent resident (green card holder), or an immigrant with a valid work visa (in some cases).\n6. **Application Process**: When applying for a Mitchell-Lama apartment, you'll need to provide documentation supporting your income, employment, and credit history. This may include:\n\t* Pay stubs\n\t* Tax returns (if self-employed)\n\t* W-2 forms\n\t* Proof of employment (e.g., letter from employer)\n\t* Credit reports (may be obtained through a background check or a credit reporting agency)\n\nKeep in mind that specific eligibility requirements might vary depending on the Mitchell-Lama development and its governing body.

You must be given written notice and an opportunity to contest the proposed termination, and an actual eviction requires a court order.\n\nWhat that means, in practical steps\n- NYCHA must give you written notice stating the reason they are terminating your lease. The notice will tell you how to request a hearing or appeal and any deadlines. Read that notice carefully and act immediately.  \n- Before an eviction is carried out, NYCHA normally must offer an administrative opportunity to challenge the termination (an informal hearing or grievance/procedural hearing under the applicable NYCHA/HUD rules). This lets you present facts and documents to dispute the grounds for termination.  \n- If NYCHA proceeds, it must then bring a holdover/summary eviction case in Housing Court. You have the right to appear in court and defend yourself; NYCHA cannot forcibly evict you without a judge\u2019s order and a marshal/constable carrying out the eviction.  \n- NYC has a right-to-counsel program that provides free lawyers for many low-income tenants facing eviction in Housing Court. You should seek legal help right away.\n\nPossible exceptions or special situations\n- Allegations of violent or dangerous criminal activity or serious threats to other residents can lead NYCHA to move faster and may affect what administrative relief is available, but even in those cases eviction still requires court proceedings before a physical eviction.  \n- Procedures and deadlines can vary depending on the specific notice and the grounds alleged, so the timeline on the notice matters.\n\nWhat to do now\n1.

If NYCHA wants to terminate your tenancy or remove you, they must file a petition in housing court and you have the right to answer and present defenses.\n- Separately, NYCHA has a Tenant Grievance Procedure you can use to challenge NYCHA\u2019s actions or decisions (including an eviction). Filing a grievance is a way to appeal NYCHA\u2019s decision internally, but it is not a prerequisite to eviction in most cases, and filing a grievance does not automatically stop the eviction.\n- You should not assume you\u2019ve lost your rights by not having filed a grievance in advance. You will still have a hearing in housing court where you can present defenses, and you can have an attorney represent you.\n\nWhat you should do now\n- Do not ignore any notices.

They apply a \u201cutility allowance\u201d\n\nIf you, not the landlord, pay some utilities (gas, electric, heat, cooking gas, etc.), the program assigns a **utility allowance** based on:\n\n- Apartment type/size  \n- Which utilities you pay  \n- NYC utility schedules\n\nYour **total \u201cgross rent\u201d = contract rent + utility allowance.**\n\n---\n\n## 5. How the subsidy is actually calculated\n\n**Step A \u2013 Determine gross rent**  \n- Gross rent = landlord\u2019s rent + utility allowance.\n\n**Step B \u2013 Compare gross rent to payment standard**  \n- NYCHA/HPD uses the **lower of**:\n  - payment standard, or  \n  - gross rent  \n\nto calculate the subsidy.\n\n**Step C \u2013 Compute subsidy**  \n- Subsidy = (lower of payment standard or gross rent) \u2212 your required tenant share  \n- If your tenant share comes out negative, they cap the subsidy at gross rent (you can\u2019t be paid to rent).\n\n---\n\n## 6. What you actually pay each month\n\nBasic rules in practice:\n\n- At move-in/lease-up, your part of the rent usually **cannot exceed 40% of your adjusted income** if the gross rent is above the payment standard.  \n- After that, at annual recertification, your share may rise above 40% if your income goes down, or if rent increases, as long as the unit remains \u201caffordable enough\u201d under the program rules.\n\nSo, **your monthly payment** \u2248  \n- 30% of your adjusted income (plus any overage if you chose a unit above the payment standard), minus any utility allowance adjustments if applicable.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete simplified example\n\nAssume:\n\n- Adjusted income: $1,500/month  \n- 30% of adjusted income: $450  \n- Payment standard for your voucher: $2,000  \n- Landlord rent: $1,900  \n- Utility allowance: $100  \n- Gross rent: $2,000 ($1,900 + $100)\n\nBecause gross rent = payment standard ($2,000), the program uses $2,000 as the basis.\n\n- Your required tenant share = $450  \n- Subsidy = $2,000 \u2212 $450 = $1,550  \n- Program pays landlord: $1,550 (HAP portion, the Housing Assistance Payment)  \n- You pay landlord: $350 (so total $450 including $100 assumed utilities)\n\nIf your rent were higher than the payment standard, your share would increase.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Your borough  \n- Voucher bedroom size  \n- Approximate household income and utilities you pay  \n\nI can walk you through a NYC-specific approximate calculation of what Section 8 would subsidize for you.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Section 8 (the Housing Choice Voucher program) pays the difference between the PHA\u2019s payment standard for your voucher size and the amount you\u2019re required to pay based on your income and circumstances. The PHA calculates a \u201cfamily share\u201d (what you must pay) and a housing assistance payment (what the PHA pays). If the unit\u2019s rent is higher than the payment standard, you must also pay the excess.\n\nHow it\u2019s calculated (step\u2011by\u2011step, in plain language)\n\n1. Contract rent and payment standard\n- The PHA approves the rent for the unit (rent reasonableness).  \n- The PHA uses a \u201cpayment standard\u201d for your voucher size (based on HUD fair market rents for your area). The payment standard is the baseline the PHA will use to determine subsidy.\n\n2. Family share (what you must pay)\n- The PHA figures your adjusted monthly income (annual income minus allowable HUD deductions). Common deductions include dependent allowances, allowable childcare or disability assistance costs that enable work, medical expenses for elderly/disabled households, and any other HUD\u2011allowed deductions. (Exact deductions and amounts are set by HUD rules and the PHA\u2019s procedures.)\n- The family share is generally determined by comparing formulas and taking the highest: typically about 30% of your adjusted monthly income, 10% of your gross monthly income, the welfare/temporary assistance shelter amount if that applies, or the PHA\u2019s minimum rent (PHAs set a minimum between $0 and $50). The PHA will apply the HUD rules and the appropriate deductions to arrive at your total tenant payment.\n\n3. Utilities / utility allowance\n- If you pay utilities, the PHA gives a utility allowance which effectively lowers the family\u2019s cash rent obligation and increases the subsidy. (The utility allowance varies by the unit\u2019s characteristics and the PHA.)\n\n4. Housing assistance payment (subsidy)\n- The PHA\u2019s subsidy (housing assistance payment, HAP) is calculated using the payment standard and the family share; however the subsidy cannot exceed the amount by which the contract rent (plus tenant\u2011paid utilities where relevant) exceeds the family share.\n- In simple terms: Subsidy = lesser of (payment standard \u2212 family share) and (contract rent \u2212 family share). If the contract rent is above the payment standard, you must pay the excess in addition to your family share.\n\nShort numeric example\n- Payment standard for your voucher size: $1,500/month.  \n- Contract rent: $1,200/month.  \n- Your family share (based on income/deductions): $750/month.\n  - payment standard \u2212 family share = $1,500 \u2212 $750 = $750\n  - contract rent \u2212 family share = $1,200 \u2212 $750 = $450\n  - subsidy = lesser = $450. You pay $750; PHA pays $450.\nIf the contract rent were $1,800 (above payment standard), subsidy = $1,500 \u2212 $750 = $750, and you\u2019d pay $750 plus the $300 excess ($1,800 \u2212 $1,500) = $1,050 total out\u2011of\u2011pocket.\n\nOther important points for NYC\n- PHAs in NYC (NYCHA, HPD, HRA, etc.) administer vouchers and set some local procedures (payment standard % of FMR, minimum rent, utility allowances). Rules on proration for households with ineligible non\u2011citizen members and on interim/annual recertifications are followed according to HUD and local PHA policy.\n- If your income changes, report to your PHA\u2014your subsidy can change at interim or annual recertification.\n- You have a right to an explanation and an informal hearing if you disagree with a determination about your subsidy.\n\nIf you want, tell me which administering agency (NYCHA, HRA, HPD, or another) and your voucher size and rough income and rent numbers, and I can walk through a specific example or tell you what documents to request from the PHA.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: your subsidy is set by a formula that uses your income, your family size, the unit\u2019s rent (and utilities), and the local payment standard. The housing authority pays the rest up to that standard. Your actual monthly rent depends on that calculation.\n\nHere\u2019s the typical way it\u2019s calculated in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (the same basic approach used nationwide, including NYC):\n\n- Step 1: figure your monthly income and deductions\n  - Your household\u2019s yearly income is \u201cannual income.\u201d From that, the housing authority subtracts eligible deductions (for things like dependents, elderly/disabled status, certain childcare or medical expenses, etc.) to get your monthly adjusted income.\n\n- Step 2: determine your portion (what you pay)\n  - Your portion of rent = about 30% of your monthly adjusted income.\n\n- Step 3: determine the unit\u2019s gross rent\n  - Gross rent = the rent charged by the landlord (contract rent) plus any utility costs the tenant must pay (or a utility allowance if you don\u2019t pay utilities directly). Some units have utilities included, some don\u2019t; the gross rent reflects what you\u2019d actually pay if you rented that unit.\n\n- Step 4: find the local payment standard\n  - The local housing authority sets a \u201cpayment standard\u201d for your family size and area. This is the maximum monthly subsidy (how much the program will pay) for a unit of that size/location. In NYC, payment standards vary by bedroom size and neighborhood/location and are published by the administering agency (the local PHA, e.g., NYCHA/HPD as applicable).\n\n- Step 5: compute the housing subsidy (HAP)\n  - HAP (the subsidy the program pays) = the lesser of:\n    - (a) gross rent minus your portion (i.e., what remains after you pay 30% of adjusted income), or\n    - (b) the payment standard for your family size/location.\n  - This ensures the voucher pays up to the allowed standard, and you pay the rest.\n\n- Step 6: your actual monthly payment\n  - In most cases, you\u2019ll end up paying about 30% of your adjusted income. If the unit\u2019s rent is high, the payment standard cap can reduce the subsidy, which means you may pay more of the rent (still subject to the 30% rule and any local minimum rent policies).\n\n NYC-specific notes\n- In NYC, the payment standard is set by the local housing authority and can vary by borough/area and by bedroom size. It\u2019s designed to reflect local rents, but it\u2019s capped (and sometimes exceptions exist) so the subsidy doesn\u2019t exceed the standard.\n- Utilities: NYC uses utility allowances to determine gross rent when tenants pay some utilities. If you pay most utilities, those costs are factored into the gross rent you see.\n- There can be occasional exceptions (e.g., unit rents above the standard in certain circumstances) with approvals from HUD, but the general rule is the lesser of the rent minus your 30% share or the payment standard.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- your household size\n- your approximate monthly adjusted income (or gross income and allowed deductions)\n- the unit\u2019s gross rent (rent to landlord plus any estimated utilities)\n\nThen I can walk you through a sample calculation for NYC and show you what subsidy amount and your monthly payment would look like. Or I can point you to the exact payment standards and utility allowances for NYC from the local housing authority.",

The rent burden is typically 30% of the AGI.\n5. **Total Tenant Payment (TTP)**: The TTP is the amount the family is required to pay towards rent, which is usually 30% of the AGI.\n6. **Voucher Rent**: The voucher rent is the maximum rent that NYCHA will pay for the unit, which is based on the local payment standard (see below).\n7. **Subsidy Amount**: The subsidy amount is the difference between the voucher rent and the TTP.\n\n**Local Payment Standards**: NYCHA sets local payment standards, which vary by borough and zip code, to determine the maximum rent that can be subsidized. The payment standards are based on the local fair market rent and are adjusted annually.\n\nFor example, if the:\n\n* Adjusted Gross Income is $30,000 per year (or $2,500 per month)\n* Rent burden is 30% (or $750 per month)\n* Voucher rent is $1,800 per month (based on the local payment standard)\n* Total Tenant Payment (TTP) is $750 per month\n\nThe subsidy amount would be $1,050 per month ($1,800 - $750).\n\nKeep in mind that these calculations can be complex, and individual circumstances may affect the subsidy amount. If you have specific questions or concerns, I recommend contacting NYCHA or a qualified housing counselor for guidance.",
            "GPT 4.1": "Section 8, also known as the Housing Choice Voucher Program, helps low-income households pay for rental housing. In New York City, the amount of rent that gets subsidized is determined by several factors:\n\n**1. Your Household Income:**  \nSection 8 calculates your \"adjusted income\" based on your household\u2019s gross income minus certain deductions (like for dependents, elderly, or disabled family members).\n\n**2. Payment Standard:**  \nThe program sets a \"payment standard\" for your household size and the area where you live.

            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, the amount of rent that gets subsidized through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program is determined by several factors, primarily based on federal guidelines and local policies. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Payment Standard**: The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) sets a payment standard for each unit size (e.g., studio, one-bedroom, etc.). This is the amount that NYCHA will pay directly to the landlord on behalf of the voucher holder. The payment standard is based on the going rent for similar units in the area.\n\n2. **Rent Reasonableness**: The rent charged by the landlord must be reasonable and comparable to rents for similar units in the area. NYCHA will inspect the unit and compare the rent to similar units to ensure it is reasonable.\n\n3. **Family's Share**: The family's share of the rent is typically 30% of their adjusted monthly income. This is calculated based on the family's gross annual income, minus certain deductions (such as for elderly or disabled family members, or for dependent children).\n\n4. **Maximum Rent Subsidy**: The maximum rent subsidy that NYCHA will pay is the lower of the payment standard or the reasonable rent for the unit.\n\nHere's a simple breakdown:\n\n- Family's Share = 30% of adjusted monthly income\n- NYCHA's Share = Lower of Payment Standard or Reasonable Rent - Family's Share\n\nFor example, if the payment standard for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,200, the reasonable rent for the unit is $1,100, and the family's share is $300, then NYCHA would pay $800 ($1,100 - $300) to the landlord.\n\nIt's always a good idea to contact NYCHA directly or consult with a housing counselor for the most accurate and up-to-date information, as policies can change and individual circumstances may vary.

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "As a housing law assistant, I can explain how Section 8 (Housing Choice Voucher program) determines your rent subsidy in NYC. The calculation is designed to ensure that housing remains affordable for low-income families, generally limiting your out-of-pocket housing costs to a manageable percentage of your income.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process, based on NYC Section 8 rules (administered by either NYC Housing Authority - NYCHA, or NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development - HPD, depending on your voucher type):\n\n**The Fundamental Principle:**\nYou, the tenant, are generally expected to pay approximately **30% of your adjusted monthly income** towards rent and utilities. Section 8 then covers the difference between your portion and the total \"gross rent\" (rent + utilities) up to a certain limit called the \"Payment Standard.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Determine Your Gross Annual Income:**\n    *   This includes all income from all adult members of your household, such as wages, salaries, social security, SSI, TANF, unemployment benefits, child support, pensions, etc.\n\n2.  **Calculate Your Adjusted Annual Income:**\n    *   This is your gross income minus certain allowable deductions. Common deductions include:\n        *   **Elderly/Disabled Deduction:** A fixed deduction for households where the head, spouse, or sole member is elderly (62+) or disabled.\n        *   **Dependent Deduction:** A fixed deduction for each dependent child, elderly person, or disabled person in the household (excluding the head, spouse, or sole member).\n        *   **Childcare Expenses:** Unreimbursed childcare expenses necessary for a household member to work or pursue education.\n        *   **Medical Expenses:** For elderly or disabled families, unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 3% of the annual gross income.\n        *   **Disability Assistance Expenses:** Unreimbursed expenses for attendant care and auxiliary apparatus for a disabled household member that enable them to work.\n\n3.  **Determine Your Monthly Tenant Rent Portion:**\n    *   Your monthly tenant rent portion is generally the **highest** of the following:\n        *   **30% of your adjusted monthly income.** (This is the most common calculation.)\n        *   10% of your gross monthly income.\n        *   A minimum rent (e.g., $50, though this can vary by program and circumstances).\n\n4.  **Determine the Payment Standard for Your Area and Unit Size:**\n    *   The **Payment Standard** is the maximum amount of subsidy Section 8 will pay for a unit of a specific size (number of bedrooms) in a particular area.\n    *   It's based on the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for the area, as determined by HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).\n    *   The Payment Standard is **not** the actual rent of your apartment, but rather a cap on the subsidy. If your actual rent plus utilities exceeds the Payment Standard, you might have to pay more out of pocket.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Utility Allowance:**\n    *   If utilities (like heat, hot water, electricity, cooking gas) are **not** included in your rent and you pay them directly, Section 8 provides a \"utility allowance.\"\n    *   This allowance is a fixed amount based on your apartment size and the type of utilities you pay for.\n    *   The utility allowance is **subtracted from your tenant rent portion** to determine your actual cash payment to the landlord. For example, if your tenant portion is $300 and your utility allowance is $100, you would pay $200 directly to the landlord, and Section 8 would pay the rest.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Subsidy Amount (What Section 8 Pays):**\n    *   The subsidy Section 8 pays is generally the **lower** of:\n        *   The Payment Standard for your unit size **minus** your tenant rent portion.\n        *   The actual gross rent (rent charged by landlord + utility allowance) **minus** your tenant rent portion.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\n*   **Gross Monthly Income:** $2,000\n*   **Adjusted Monthly Income:** $1,800 (after deductions)\n*   **Tenant Rent Portion (30% of adjusted income):** $1,800 * 0.30 = $540\n*   **Actual Monthly Rent Charged by Landlord:** $1,500\n*   **Utilities You Pay Directly:** Heat, hot water, electricity\n*   **Utility Allowance:** $200\n*   **Gross Rent (for calculation purposes):** $1,500 (rent) + $200 (utility allowance) = $1,700\n*   **Payment Standard for your unit size:** $1,600\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Your Tenant Portion:** $540\n2.  **Your Cash Payment to Landlord:** $540 (tenant portion) - $200 (utility allowance) = **$340**\n3.  **Section 8 Subsidy:**\n    *   Option A: Payment Standard - Tenant Portion = $1,600 - $540 = $1,060\n    *   Option B: Gross Rent - Tenant Portion = $1,700 - $540 = $1,160\n    *   Section 8 pays the **lower** of these two, which is **$1,060**.\n\n**In this example:**\n*   You pay $340 to the landlord.\n*   You pay your utilities (which are covered by the $200 utility allowance, effectively making your total housing cost $340 + actual utility bills).\n*   Section 8 pays $1,060 to the landlord.\n*   The landlord receives $340 (from you) + $1,060 (from Section 8) = $1,400.\n*   **Wait!** The landlord charges $1,500. This means the total amount paid ($1,400) is less than the actual rent ($1,500). This is where the \"Payment Standard\" comes into play. Since the Gross Rent ($1,700) exceeds the Payment Standard ($1,600), the tenant might have to pay more.\n\n**Crucial NYC Rule: Initial Rent Burden Limit (40% Rule)**\n\nWhen you first move into a new unit with a Section 8 voucher, your share of the rent (including utilities) **cannot exceed 40% of your adjusted monthly income.** If it does, the unit will not be approved. This rule helps prevent tenants from being over-burdened by rent even with a subsidy.\n\n**Revisiting the Example with the 40% Rule:**\n\n*   Your Adjusted Monthly Income: $1,800\n*   Your Tenant Portion (30% of adjusted income): $540\n*   Gross Rent (Rent + Utility Allowance): $1,700\n*   Payment Standard: $1,600\n\nSince the Gross Rent ($1,700) is higher than the Payment Standard ($1,600), you would be responsible for the difference between the Gross Rent and the Payment Standard, *in addition* to your 30% portion.\n\n*   Your total housing cost would be: $540 (your 30% portion) + ($1,700 Gross Rent - $1,600 Payment Standard) = $540 + $100 = $640.\n*   Now, check the 40% rule: $640 / $1,800 (adjusted income) = 0.355 or **35.5%**.\n*   Since 35.5% is less than 40%, this unit *would* be approved at move-in.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Income Changes:** You must report any changes in your household income or composition to your housing authority promptly. This will trigger a recalculation of your rent portion.\n*   **Annual Recertification:** Your income and household composition will be reviewed annually, and your rent portion will be adjusted accordingly.\n*   **Administering Agency:** In NYC, NYCHA administers most Section 8 vouchers, but HPD also administers some, particularly for specific projects or populations. The core calculation principles are the same, but specific forms or processes might differ slightly.\n\nIt's always best to consult directly with your specific housing authority (NYCHA or HPD) for the most accurate and personalized information regarding your Section 8 subsidy calculation.",
            "llama3": "The Section 8 program, officially known as the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, is a federal rental assistance program that helps low-income families and individuals pay their rent. The program is administered by local public housing agencies (PHAs) in partnership with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n\nTo determine how much of your rent gets subsidized, Section 8 uses a complex formula that takes into account several factors. Here's an overview:\n\n1. **Maximum Allowable Rent** (MAR): This is the maximum amount the PHA will pay as rental assistance per month. The MAR is calculated by multiplying the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for your area by the percentage of income you're eligible to spend on housing.\n2. **Family Income**: Your family's gross income, which includes all sources of income, such as wages, Social Security benefits, and child support.\n3. **Gross Rent**: The total rent you pay each month, including utilities and other charges.\n4. **Deductions**: You may be eligible for deductions from your gross income, such as:\n\t* Childcare costs\n\t* Medical expenses\n\t* Dependent care expenses (e.g., elderly or disabled family members)\n5. **Gross Income minus Deductions**: This is the amount of your income that's available to pay rent.\n6. **Rent Calculation**: Multiply your gross income minus deductions by the percentage of income you're eligible to spend on housing (usually 30%).\n7. **Maximum Rent Payment**: Compare this calculation with the MAR. If the calculation result is lower than the MAR, your actual subsidy will be equal to the calculation result. If it's higher, your subsidy will be capped at the MAR.\n8. **Tenant Payable Share**: This is the amount you'll need to pay as rent each month (your portion of the total rent). It's calculated by subtracting the subsidy from the gross rent.\n\nFor example:\n\n* MAR: $1,200\n* Family Income: $2,500 per month\n* Gross Rent: $1,400\n* Deductions: $100 (childcare costs)\n* Gross Income minus Deductions: $2,400 ($2,500 - $100)\n* Rent Calculation: 30% of $2,400 = $720\n* Maximum Rent Payment: $720 (less than MAR)\n* Tenant Payable Share: $240 (=$1,400 - $720)\n\nIn this example, the tenant would pay $240 as their share of the rent each month, and Section 8 would cover the remaining $720.\n\nKeep in mind that your specific circumstances may affect your subsidy calculation. It's always a good idea to review your subsidy determination with your local PHA or housing counselor to ensure accuracy."

            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: No \u2014 in most cases your landlord cannot unilaterally change the terms of an existing lease. A lease is a contract; the landlord is bound by its terms for the length of the fixed term and cannot alter them without your consent. There are some important exceptions and details depending on the type of tenancy and on rent regulation.\n\nKey points (NYC):\n\n- Fixed-term lease (for example, one-year lease): the landlord generally cannot change rent, rules, services, or other lease terms during the lease term. Any change requires your agreement in writing. If the landlord tries to force a change, that is a breach of the lease.\n\n- Month-to-month tenancy (periodic tenancy): the landlord can propose changes, but must give proper written notice in advance (typically a notice period equal to the rental period \u2014 e.g., 30 days for month-to-month \u2014 and follow applicable state/local rules). If you don\u2019t agree, the landlord must either accept your refusal or terminate the tenancy with proper notice and lawfully proceed; they can\u2019t just impose the change while you remain in occupancy without following notice/eviction procedures.\n\n- Rent-regulated units (rent-stabilized or rent-controlled): special protections apply. Landlords cannot impose illegal rent increases or change material lease terms except as allowed by law or with your written consent. Rent-stabilized tenants have additional rights (renewal offers, regulated increases, DHCR oversight). If you think the unit is rent-regulated, contact the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or 311 for help.\n\n- Habitability and essential services: a landlord cannot lawfully reduce essential services (heat, hot water, locks, electricity, etc.) or otherwise take actions that make the apartment uninhabitable to force you to accept changes. Such conduct can be tenant harassment and is illegal under NYC rules.\n\nWhat you should do now\n\n1. Check your lease to see if it\u2019s fixed-term or month-to-month and read any \u201cmodification\u201d or \u201camendment\u201d clauses.\n2. Do not sign anything you don\u2019t agree to. Requests to sign unilateral \u201camendments\u201d should be treated cautiously.\n3. Respond in writing that you do not agree to any change (if you don\u2019t), and keep copies of all communications.\n4. Continue to pay rent according to your current lease terms so you don\u2019t give the landlord a basis for eviction.\n5. If the landlord persists or is harassing you, contact NYC 311 for tenant resources and help, or get legal assistance \u2014 for example Legal Aid Society, or other tenant-rights organizations and housing attorneys. If it\u2019s a rent-stabilized unit, contact DHCR (or visit their website) to check your rights and rent history.\n6. If needed, you can bring the matter to Housing Court or file complaints with HPD or DHCR depending on the issue.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- whether your lease is fixed-term or month-to-month,\n- whether you think the unit is rent-stabilized, and\n- what specific change the landlord is demanding \u2014\n\nand I can give more specific next steps and sample language for a written response.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: No. If you have a fixed-term lease, your landlord cannot unilaterally change the lease terms during the term. Any changes to the lease generally have to be agreed to in writing by both you and the landlord (usually by signing an amendment or a new lease).\n\nWhat this usually means in practice\n- Fixed-term lease (e.g., 12 months): The terms stay as written until the lease ends. If the landlord wants different terms, they must offer a new lease or an amendment that you sign.\n- At renewal or for a new tenancy: The landlord can propose new terms, but you must agree in writing to those terms to make them binding.\n- After the term ends (month-to-month): Either party can propose changes, but the other party must agree. For month-to-month tenancies, landlords typically must give proper written notice before increasing rent or changing terms. The exact rules can depend on whether the unit is rent-stabilized or not.\n- Rent-stabilized units: Increases at renewal are limited by the Rent Guidelines Board. Other terms can be changed only through a signed renewal/addendum; the landlord can propose new terms but cannot unilaterally impose them mid-lease.\n- House rules: Landlords can adopt reasonable house rules, but these cannot contradict the lease and generally must be provided in writing. They do not automatically change the lease terms; you must agree if the rules amount to a change in your rights or obligations.\n\nWhat to do if your landlord asks for changes\n- Do not sign any amendment you don\u2019t agree with. Ask for the exact language showing what would change and when it would take effect.\n- Request a written copy of the proposed amendment or new lease and read it carefully.\n- If you want to keep the current terms, communicate that in writing and keep a copy.\n- If you\u2019re in a rent-stabilized unit and the change involves rent or renewal, know your rights and consider consulting a tenant attorney or DHCR for guidance.\n- If you\u2019re unsure, you can contact NYC 311 for general housing guidance, or seek assistance from a tenants\u2019 rights group, legal aid, or a housing attorney.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Is your unit rent-stabilized or not?\n- Is the lease currently fixed-term or already month-to-month?\n- What specific terms is the landlord trying to change?\n\nI can tailor the guidance to your situation and point you to the right resources.",

Both parties must sign the amendment.\n\n2. **Legal Changes**: If there are changes in laws or regulations that affect the lease, the landlord may need to comply with these changes. However, this does not give the landlord the right to arbitrarily change other lease terms.\n\n3. **Renewal**: When the lease is up for renewal, the landlord can propose new terms. The tenant is not obligated to accept these new terms and can choose to move out or negotiate.\n\n4. **Material Breach**: If the tenant materially breaches the lease, the landlord may have grounds to modify the lease terms or terminate the lease, but this should be done through proper legal channels.\n\n5. **Rent Stabilization/Rent Control**: If the apartment is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled, there are specific rules and protections in place that limit how and when the landlord can change lease terms. For example, rent increases are subject to guidelines set by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n\nIf your landlord is insisting on changing the lease terms without your agreement, you may want to consult with a legal aid society or a tenant rights organization to understand your rights and options. Some resources include:\n\n- The Legal Aid Society\n- New York State Tenants & Neighbors Information Line\n- Metropolitan Council on Housing\n- Housing Court Answers\n\nIt's always a good idea to document any communications with your landlord regarding lease changes and to keep records of your lease and any amendments.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "No, your landlord generally **cannot unilaterally change the terms of your lease whenever they want during the lease term** in NYC.\n\nHere's why, based on NYC housing law:\n\n1.  **A Lease is a Binding Contract:** Once you and your landlord sign a lease, it becomes a legally binding contract. Both parties are bound by its terms and conditions for the entire duration of the lease period.\n\n2.  **Mutual Agreement for Changes:** Any changes to the lease terms *during the lease period* typically require the **mutual agreement and consent of both the landlord and the tenant.** This means if your landlord proposes a change (e.g., increasing rent mid-lease, adding new rules not in the original lease, changing access rights), you have the right to refuse it. You are not obligated to agree to or sign an addendum that alters your current lease.\n\n3.  **Distinction for Lease Renewal:** The situation is different when your lease is up for renewal:\n    *   **For market-rate (non-stabilized) leases:** When your current lease expires, the landlord can propose a *new* lease with different terms (including a higher rent). You then have the choice to accept the new terms or move out.\n    *   **For rent-stabilized leases:** Landlords are generally required to offer a renewal lease on the *same terms and conditions* as the expiring lease, with only legally permissible rent increases. They cannot unilaterally change other material terms of a rent-stabilized lease at renewal.\n\n**What to Do if Your Landlord Tries to Change Terms Mid-Lease:**\n\n*   **Refer to your lease:** Politely remind your landlord that the current lease is a binding contract and that its terms cannot be changed without your agreement.\n*   **Do not agree to changes you don't want:** You are not obligated to sign any new documents or agree to new terms that you don't consent to.\n*   **Document everything:** Keep records of any communication (emails, texts, letters) where your landlord attempts to change terms.\n*   **Seek legal advice:** If your landlord persists, threatens you, or tries to enforce changes without your agreement, it's advisable to contact a housing attorney or a tenant rights organization in NYC (such as Legal Aid Society, Met Council on Housing, or Housing Court Answers) for specific guidance.\n\nIn summary, your landlord's statement is generally incorrect under NYC law. You are protected by the terms of your signed lease for its duration.",
            "llama3": "In most cases, landlords cannot unilaterally (without your consent) change the lease terms once a lease has been signed. However, there are some exceptions and limitations to consider.\n\n**Typically, lease agreements have a provision called \"mutual consent\" or \"written agreement.\"**\n\nThis means that if either party wants to make changes to the lease terms, both parties must agree in writing before making any changes. If your landlord wants to modify the lease terms without your consent, they would need to obtain your written approval.\n\n**However, there are some scenarios where a landlord might be able to change the lease terms:**\n\n1. **Notice provisions:** Some leases include notice provisions that allow the landlord to make certain changes with a specific amount of advance notice (e.g., 30 days). If you've agreed to such a provision in your lease, your landlord may be able to make changes as long as they provide the required notice.\n2. **Changes not affecting essential terms:** Some jurisdictions have laws or regulations that allow landlords to make non-material changes to leases without obtaining tenant consent. Non-material changes typically don't affect the essential terms of the lease, such as rent, term, or responsibility for repairs.\n3. **Special circumstances:** In some cases, a court might deem it reasonable for a landlord to modify a lease in response to extraordinary circumstances, such as a natural disaster or significant changes in local laws.\n\n**To protect yourself:**\n\n1. Review your lease agreement carefully: Understand the terms and conditions of your lease, including any notice provisions.\n2. Document all agreements: Keep records of any agreements or understandings you have with your landlord regarding lease modifications.\n3. Seek legal advice if necessary: If you're unsure about your landlord's ability to modify the lease terms or need guidance on how to protect yourself, consult with a tenant attorney or housing expert.\n\nRemember that it's essential to communicate with your landlord and maintain open lines of communication to resolve any issues that may arise during the tenancy."

However, a lease for a term longer than one year must be in writing to be enforceable (Statute of Frauds principle).\n\nWhether the apartment is rent\u2011stabilized changes other rules:\n- If it IS rent\u2011stabilized, you have statutory protections (rent registration, required written renewal offers, regulated rent increases, etc.) regardless of whether the original lease was oral. Landlords must follow the rent\u2011stabilization rules even if a tenant claims an oral lease.\n- If it is NOT rent\u2011stabilized, the oral lease is still valid so long as the term is one year or less, but it can be harder to prove the exact terms (rent amount, length, any special agreements) if a dispute arises.\n\nPractical advice\n- Get the agreement in writing if possible and keep records of rent payments (cancelled checks, bank transfers, receipts).\n- Ask for a written lease or at least a written confirmation of key terms (rent, term, security deposit).\n- If you believe the unit should be rent\u2011stabilized or you have a dispute, contact NYC 311, the DHCR (for stabilization questions), or a tenant/legal aid organization for advice or court assistance.\n\nIf you want, tell me the term you agreed to and whether you think the unit might be rent\u2011stabilized and I can give more specific guidance.",

Under New York law (the Statute of Frauds, General Obligations Law \u00a75-701), contracts for the lease of real property for more than one year must be in writing to be enforceable. If your term is more than a year and there is only an oral agreement, the terms may not be enforceable as a long-term lease.\n- If the term is 12 months or less, an oral lease is generally enforceable (but not ideal). If you continue living there after the oral term ends, the tenancy can become month-to-month (or year-to-year, depending on how the tenancy was paid and accepted), rather than having a guaranteed fixed term.\n- Not rent-stabilized just means there are no rent-stabilization protections or limits on increases. It does not violate any rule to have a non\u2013rent-stabilized apartment with an oral lease. The landlord can set the rent at market rate and renewals aren\u2019t governed by stabilization rules.\n- Regardless of stabilization status, many landlords and tenants prefer a written lease to avoid disputes about rent amount, due dates, responsibilities, and renewal rights.

            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: usually no. Under New York law an oral agreement for a lease longer than one year is generally not enforceable in court because of the statute of frauds. That means a spoken-only 2\u2011year lease will usually not be recognized as a binding lease you can sue to enforce.\n\nKey points \u2014 what the law says\n- Statute of frauds: New York General Obligations Law \u00a75\u2011701(1) requires leases longer than one year to be in writing and signed to be enforceable in an action at law. A 2\u2011year oral agreement falls within that rule.\n- Practical effect: if you try to sue to force performance of a 2\u2011year oral lease (for possession, specific terms, or rent owed under that agreement), a court will usually refuse to enforce it.\n\nImportant exceptions and practical realities\n- Part performance / equitable estoppel: Courts may enforce an oral lease despite the statute of frauds in limited circumstances if there is clear evidence of part performance (for example, the tenant took possession and paid rent and the landlord accepted it) or if the landlord would be unjustly enriched otherwise. These are fact-specific defenses, not guaranteed.\n- Month\u2011to\u2011month implication: if the landlord accepted rent periodically (monthly), courts often treat the arrangement as a periodic tenancy (month\u2011to\u2011month) rather than a 2\u2011year fixed lease\u2014so the landlord or tenant may be able to end the tenancy with proper notice under landlord\u2011tenant law.\n- Rent\u2011stabilized/controlled units: separate rules apply to regulated units. Rent\u2011stabilized tenants have statutory renewal rights and other protections, and those rights don\u2019t rely solely on a written private lease.\n\nWhat each side can and can\u2019t typically do\n- Tenant who wants to enforce the 2\u2011year term: difficult unless you have strong evidence of part performance (possession, payments, writings, witnesses). You could try to argue estoppel, but success depends on the facts.\n- Landlord who wants to enforce the 2\u2011year term (for example, to prevent a tenant from leaving early): similarly constrained; landlord may have trouble forcing the tenant to stay under a purely oral 2\u2011year agreement.\n- Landlord who wants to evict before two years: if the tenancy has been treated as month\u2011to\u2011month (rent accepted monthly), the landlord may be able to terminate with proper notice and bring a holdover proceeding.\n\nWhat you should do now\n- Get it in writing immediately. A written lease signed by both parties is the cleanest protection.\n- Preserve evidence: texts, emails, rent receipts, cancelled checks, witnesses, any notes of the agreement and move\u2011in behavior showing possession.\n- Pay by traceable methods and keep records (if you want to rely on payments as part performance).\n- If there\u2019s a dispute, consult a lawyer or a tenant/landlord clinic (Legal Aid Society, NYC tenant associations) quickly \u2014 the facts determine whether an exception applies.\n\nIf you want, tell me more about what you and the landlord actually did (did you move in, pay rent, receive keys, etc.?) and whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized. I can suggest more specific next steps.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: not as a 2-year lease.\n\nWhy:\n- In New York, leases of real property for more than one year must be in writing to be enforceable. A verbally agreed 2-year lease is generally not enforceable as a two-year contract.\n- What a court would likely enforce is a month-to-month (or other periodic) tenancy created by the oral agreement and your ongoing occupancy and rent payments. In that case, either side can usually end the tenancy with proper notice (typically about 30 days in NYC for a month-to-month tenancy).\n\nWhat you should know:\n- If you want a guaranteed 2-year term, you need a written lease signed by both parties.\n- If the apartment is subject to rent stabilization or rent control, there are separate renewal rights and requirements that may apply, which usually still require a written renewal lease to formalize terms.\n- If there is a dispute now, a court would likely treat the arrangement as a month-to-month tenancy unless there\u2019s a clear, written lease documenting a longer term.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about your situation (for example, whether the apartment is rent-stabilized or whether there\u2019s any applicable \u201cpartial performance\u201d exception), consider consulting a NYC housing attorney or a legal aid clinic for a quick review of your facts. They can help you determine the exact status and next steps, including whether you should press for a written lease or prepare for a possible holdover/eviction action.",
            "Llama 4 Scout": "In New York City, a verbal agreement can be binding, but there are limitations. According to the New York City Administrative Code and the New York State Real Property Law, a lease with a term of more than one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds.\n\nIn your case, since the agreed-upon lease term is 2 years, it falls under the category of leases that require a written agreement to be enforceable. \n\nWhile you and your landlord may have verbally agreed to a 2-year lease, neither of you can enforce it in court without a written lease, as it does not meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. If a dispute arises, a court may not recognize the verbal agreement, and the parties may be subject to different terms or conditions.\n\nTo avoid such issues, it's essential to have a written lease agreement that outlines the terms, including the length of the lease, rent, and other conditions. If you're in a situation where a verbal agreement exists, consider requesting a written lease from your landlord or seeking advice from a housing professional or attorney.",
            "GPT 4.1": "In New York City (and New York State), a lease agreement for more than one year **must be in writing** to be enforceable in court. This is due to the **Statute of Frauds** (New York General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-701), which requires that any agreement that cannot be performed within one year from its making must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged.\n\n**What this means for you:**\n- A **verbal agreement** for a 2-year lease is **not enforceable in court** by either the landlord or the tenant.\n- Either party could, in theory, back out of the agreement, and the other would not be able to enforce the 2-year term in court.\n- If you move in and start paying rent, you may be considered a month-to-month tenant unless and until a written lease is signed.\n\n**Exception:** If you have already moved in and both parties act as if there is a lease (for example, you pay rent and the landlord accepts it), you may have some rights as a tenant, but the 2-year term itself would still not be enforceable without a written lease.\n\n**Bottom line:** For a lease longer than one year in NYC, you need a written, signed lease to have enforceable rights to the full term. Verbal agreements for such leases are not enforceable in court.",
            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, verbal agreements for leases that are longer than one year are generally not enforceable in court. This is because the Statute of Frauds requires that certain types of contracts, including leases for more than one year, must be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nHere are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Statute of Frauds**: According to the Statute of Frauds, any lease for a term longer than one year must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged (the landlord, in this case) to be enforceable.\n\n2. **Partial Performance**: There are some exceptions to the Statute of Frauds, such as partial performance. However, these exceptions are narrowly interpreted and typically do not apply to residential leases.\n\n3. **Month-to-Month Tenancy**: If you have been living in the property and paying rent, you may have established a month-to-month tenancy. This means that you are considered a tenant at will, and either party can terminate the tenancy with proper notice (usually 30 days for tenants who have lived in the property for less than a year, and 60 days for tenants who have lived in the property for a year or more).\n\n4. **Eviction Protections**: Even if you do not have a written lease, you still have certain rights as a tenant under New York City and State law. For example, your landlord must follow proper eviction procedures and cannot simply lock you out or shut off your utilities.\n\nGiven these points, it is unlikely that either you or your landlord could enforce a verbal 2-year lease agreement in court. However, it is always a good idea to consult with a legal professional or a housing attorney for advice tailored to your specific situation. Additionally, it is recommended to always have a written lease agreement for any rental period longer than one year to ensure enforceability.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "No, under New York State law (which applies to NYC), a verbal agreement for a lease term longer than one year is generally **unenforceable** in court by either party.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Statute of Frauds:** New York's Statute of Frauds requires that any agreement that cannot be performed within one year must be in writing to be enforceable. A 2-year lease clearly falls under this requirement.\n\n2.  **What it Becomes:** If you move in and start paying rent based on a verbal agreement for a term longer than one year, the tenancy is typically treated as a **month-to-month tenancy**.\n\n**Implications for You and the Landlord:**\n\n*   **Neither party can enforce the 2-year term.** You cannot force the landlord to let you stay for two years, and the landlord cannot force you to pay rent for two years.\n*   **Termination:** Either you or the landlord can terminate the month-to-month tenancy by providing proper written notice. The required notice period depends on how long you have occupied the unit:\n    *   **Less than 1 year:** 30 days' notice\n    *   **Between 1 and 2 years:** 60 days' notice\n    *   **More than 2 years:** 90 days' notice\n\n**In summary:** While you may have verbally agreed to a 2-year lease, that specific term is not legally binding. Your tenancy would be considered month-to-month, giving both you and the landlord more flexibility to end the agreement with appropriate notice.\n\n**Recommendation:** Always get lease agreements in writing to ensure clarity and enforceability for both parties.",
            "llama3": "A verbal agreement, also known as an oral contract, can be legally binding and enforceable in court. However, the process and requirements for enforcing a verbal lease agreement may differ slightly from those for written agreements.\n\nIn general, to enforce a verbal lease agreement in court, you'll need to prove the following:\n\n1. **There was a mutual understanding**: Show that both parties agreed to the terms of the lease, including the duration (2 years in your case).\n2. **The agreement was binding**: Demonstrate that the agreement was intended to be legally binding and not just a casual arrangement.\n3. **Consideration was given**: Prove that one or both parties provided something of value (e.g., rent, services) in exchange for the lease.\n\nTo establish these elements, you may need to provide evidence such as:\n\n* Witness testimony from people who were present when the agreement was made\n* Records of payments made or received under the agreement\n* Correspondence or emails discussing the terms and duration of the lease\n* Testimony from yourself or other parties involved in the agreement\n\nKeep in mind that verbal agreements can be harder to prove than written ones, as there may be no physical evidence or written record. However, if you have sufficient evidence and a clear understanding of the terms, you may still be able to enforce the agreement in court.\n\nOn the other hand, the tenant (the person who agreed to lease) might argue that:\n\n1. **There was no formal agreement**: They might claim that the verbal agreement was not binding or was merely an informal arrangement.\n2. **The terms were unclear**: The tenant could argue that the duration of the lease was not clearly established or was ambiguous.\n\nTo address these potential concerns, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the terms and duration of the lease, as well as any other important details (e.g., rent, utilities, responsibilities).\n\nIf you're unsure about the enforceability of your verbal lease agreement or need assistance with the process, consider consulting with an attorney or mediator who specializes in landlord-tenant law. They can help you navigate the legal system and provide guidance on how to protect your interests."

            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Probably not \u2014 at least not completely. In New York City courts, boilerplate lease language that attempts to absolve a residential landlord of responsibility for injuries caused by the landlord\u2019s own negligence is often unenforceable as contrary to public policy or because it tries to waive statutory housing protections. Whether a particular clause will be enforced depends on the exact language, the context (residential vs. commercial), and other facts.\n\nWhat to know\n- Statutory and code obligations: Landlords have duties under the Housing Maintenance Code, Multiple Dwelling Law and the implied warranty of habitability. Tenants generally cannot contract away those protections.\n- Negligence vs. gross negligence/willful misconduct: Courts are more likely to strike down clauses that attempt to relieve a landlord of ordinary negligence in a standard residential tenancy. Even where a waiver is enforced, many courts will not allow a waiver for gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing.\n- Residential vs. commercial: Exculpatory clauses are more likely to be enforced in commercial leases where the parties are relatively sophisticated and bargained at arm\u2019s length. Standard consumer/residential leases with take-it-or-leave-it terms get closer scrutiny.\n- Wording and conspicuousness matter: A narrowly tailored, clear, and conspicuous clause negotiated by the parties is more likely to survive than a vague boilerplate clause buried in the lease.\n\nPractical next steps if you\u2019re injured\n1. Get medical care right away and keep medical records.\n2. Report the incident to the landlord in writing (email/text is okay, but keep copies).\n3. Preserve evidence: photos, the hazardous condition, shoes/clothes, repair records, building logs, and contact information for witnesses.\n4. Don\u2019t sign any release or accept a quick settlement without getting legal advice.\n5. Time limits: don\u2019t wait too long \u2014 personal-injury claims in New York typically have a three-year statute of limitations (consult a lawyer for exact deadlines that apply to your situation).\n6.

New York law treats landlords as having a duty to keep the rental premises safe, and you usually can\u2019t contract away liability for their negligent failure to maintain or repair.\n\nWhy this is usually not enforceable\n- Implied warranty of habitability: In a residential lease, the landlord has an ongoing duty to keep the unit reasonably safe and habitable. A clause attempting to waive liability for injuries caused by the landlord\u2019s negligence clashes with that duty and is typically not enforceable.\n- Public policy: Courts generally disfavor waivers that excuse a party from negligent conduct, especially in housing where tenants rely on the landlord to maintain safe conditions.\n- Scope of liability: Such clauses are rarely read as covering the landlord\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct, but even ordinary negligence claims tied to failure to repair or maintain are usually not shielded by the lease.\n\nWhat you can do\n- Do not assume the clause will protect you. If you\u2019re injured, report the hazard to the landlord promptly and seek medical care.\n- Gather evidence: photos of the hazard, dates of notices you gave the landlord, maintenance requests, medical records, and any witness statements.\n- File appropriate complaints: If the hazard is a building code or safety violation, you can contact NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) or your local housing agency; you can also file a claim in housing court for breach of the warranty of habitability or for damages from the injury.\n- Consider legal counsel: A tenant-side attorney can evaluate whether the clause is enforceable in your specific case and help you pursue a claim for damages or rent abatement.\n\nImportant caveats\n- The exact enforceability can depend on facts (e.g., whether the hazard was latent or known to the landlord, whether the landlord had actual notice, what the lease says elsewhere, etc.). There can be other lease provisions that complicate things.\n- If the injury was caused by your own actions or a third party\u2019s fault, the clause may not apply in the same way, but it still doesn\u2019t generally absolve the landlord for their own negligent failures to maintain.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me a bit about the building, the injury, and what the lease says exactly, and I can help assess the likely strength of a claim and what steps to take next.

For example:\n\n* In California, a court ruled that a hold harmless clause was unenforceable because it attempted to shift the risk of injury from the landlord to the tenant (Wong v. Patel, 2014).\n* In New York, another court invalidated a similar clause, finding it was against public policy and contrary to the state's laws regarding landlord liability for injuries caused by their negligence (Morgan v. Katz, 2001).\n\nThat being said, there may be situations where a hold harmless clause could be enforceable:\n\n* If the tenant is an experienced or professional user of the property (e.g., a business or commercial entity), they might be expected to assume some level of risk.\n* In cases involving intentional or reckless conduct by the landlord (as opposed to simple negligence), a court may find that the tenant's assumption of risk is reasonable.\n\nTo challenge such a lease clause, you would need to demonstrate that it's unreasonable, unfair, or violates public policy.

New York courts scrutinize those clauses and will not enforce routine, boilerplate jury\u2011trial waivers against residential tenants unless there is clear evidence the tenant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right (for example, a conspicuous, separate written waiver that the tenant expressly signed or initialed). A lease with a one\u2011line jury waiver in small print is unlikely to be enforced against an ordinary tenant; the result can be different for negotiated commercial leases between sophisticated parties.\n\nWhat to expect and what you can do\n- If you sue your landlord (or they sue you) and want a jury, you should demand a jury trial. If the landlord points to the lease clause, you can oppose enforcement and ask the court to find the waiver invalid as involuntary or an adhesion term.  \n- Factors courts consider: whether the waiver was conspicuous and separate, whether the tenant was sophisticated or had legal advice, whether the waiver was freely negotiated, and whether there is clear, knowing consent.  \n- If you already signed a lease with such a clause, that alone does not automatically bar you from a jury \u2014 but the outcome depends on the clause\u2019s form and the facts.  \n- If this is a commercial lease or you are a sophisticated party, the clause is more likely to be enforced.\n\nNext steps\n- Preserve your lease and any negotiation records.  \n- When you file or are served with a claim, timely demand a jury. If the landlord moves to enforce the waiver, get an attorney to oppose the motion.  \n- If you want free/low\u2011cost help in NYC, contact Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC, or a tenant advocacy organization for advice and representation.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether this is a residential or commercial lease and whether you signed any separate jury\u2011waiver form; I can give more specific guidance about how likely a court is to enforce the clause and what arguments to raise.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: Likely not allowed/enforceable for personal injury or property-damage claims.\n\nWhy this is the case (in plain terms):\n- The right to a jury trial for tort claims (like personal injury or premises liability against your landlord) is protected by the Seventh Amendment and generally by New York law.\n- A lease clause that tries to make you sign away your right to a jury for \u201cany\u201d dispute, including tort claims arising from the property, is typically void as a matter of public policy. Courts in New York routinely scrutinate waivers that would effectively bar a jury trial for negligence or dangerous-conditions claims about the property.\n- In many leases, landlords try to save the right to a jury for contract-only disputes (e.g., breach of the lease) but they cannot extend that waiver to tort claims related to the landlord\u2019s maintenance, safety defects, or other injuries on the premises.\n\nWhat could still be enforceable:\n- A waiver of the right to a jury trial for purely contractual disputes (breach of the lease, rent disputes, etc.) is sometimes enforceable if the waiver is clearly limited to contract claims, and not to tort claims. A general clause that attempts to bar all claims, including personal injury, is the part that\u2019s likely invalid.\n\nWhat you should do:\n- If you\u2019re negotiating a new lease, push to remove any language that bars a jury trial for injury or property-damage claims, and especially carve out any tort claims from any waiver.\n- If you already signed the lease and you later need to sue for personal injury or property damage, the waiver is unlikely to prevent you from going to court with a jury, and you should still pursue the claim in court. A lawyer can help you evaluate the specific wording of your lease and the best way to proceed.\n- If the landlord tries to force arbitration or a non-jury process for a tort claim, consult a tenant attorney, because some arbitration provisions can be challenged or carved out in tort scenarios.\n\nNote: This is general information and not legal advice. For your exact situation, have a NYC tenant attorney review your lease and any injuries or property-damage claims you\u2019re considering, so they can assess how the clause would apply to your case and guide you on the best steps. If you want, tell me the lease language (or key phrases) and I can help interpret how a court might view it.",

            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, lease provisions that waive the right to a jury trial are generally considered unenforceable. The New York Court of Appeals has held that such waivers are against public policy and are void. This means that even if your lease includes a clause stating that you give up your right to a jury trial, you would still have the right to a jury trial if you sue your landlord for personal injury or property damage.\n\nHere are a few relevant points:\n\n1. **Public Policy**: New York courts have consistently held that waivers of the right to a jury trial are against public policy because they interfere with the fundamental right to a jury trial guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions.\n\n2. **Unconscionability**: Even if a waiver of jury trial were not against public policy, it could still be deemed unconscionable. Unconscionability is a doctrine that allows courts to refuse to enforce a contract or clause that is grossly unfair or oppressive.\n\n3. **Statutory Protections**: New York's Real Property Law and General Obligations Law provide protections for tenants, and courts have interpreted these laws to include the right to a jury trial in certain disputes.\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you need to sue your landlord, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specific circumstances of your case.",

            "llama3": "In the United States, it depends on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances. Generally speaking, an agreement that waives your right to a jury trial is known as a \"jury waiver\" or \"right-to-jury-trial waiver.\" The enforceability of such a provision in a lease depends on various factors.\n\n**Federal Law:**\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts state laws and requires the enforcement of written arbitration agreements, including those that waive jury trials. However, the FAA only applies to contracts involving interstate commerce or affecting trade between states. If your lease is solely a local agreement, federal law may not be directly applicable.\n\n**State Law:**\nEach state has its own laws regarding the enforceability of jury waivers in leases. Some states may uphold such provisions, while others may invalidate them as unconscionable or against public policy.\n\n**Constitutional Considerations:**\nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial for certain types of cases. However, there is some debate about whether this provision applies to personal injury claims arising from landlord-tenant disputes.\n\n**Enforceability of Jury Waivers in Leases:**\nCourts have addressed the issue of enforceability in various jurisdictions:\n\n1. **Some courts uphold jury waivers:** In states like California, Florida, and New York, courts have enforced jury waiver provisions in leases, citing the FAA's preemption of state laws.\n2. **Other courts invalidate jury waivers:** In states like Texas and Illinois, courts have found such provisions to be unconscionable or against public policy, invalidating them.\n\nTo determine the enforceability of a jury waiver in your lease, you should consult with an attorney familiar with local laws and precedents. They can assess the specific circumstances and advise on the best course of action.\n\n**Takeaway:**\nWhile there is no straightforward answer, it's crucial to understand that:\n\n* The enforceability of a jury waiver provision depends on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances.\n* Federal law may not apply if the lease is solely local.\n* State laws and court decisions vary regarding the enforcement of such provisions.\n\nIf you're concerned about the enforceability of a jury waiver in your lease, consult with an attorney to determine the best course of action."

Under New York\u2019s \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d each side generally pays its own attorneys\u2019 fees unless a statute or a contract expressly shifts fees to the other side. A lease that expressly says the landlord can recover fees if the landlord sues does not, by itself, give the tenant the right to recover fees unless the lease also says the tenant can, the language is construed to be reciprocal, or there is some separate statutory or equitable basis to award fees.\n\nWhat to know and check next\n- Read the exact clause. If it says something like \u201cLandlord shall be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees\u201d and says nothing about the tenant, most courts will treat it as a one\u2011way fee\u2011shifting provision that benefits only the landlord. If the language awards fees \u201cto the prevailing party\u201d then both sides can recover when they prevail.\n- Look for statutes or claims that carry attorney\u2011fee awards. Certain housing, consumer\u2011protection, or landlord/tenant statutes (or specific causes of action such as rent\u2011overcharge or some discrimination claims) may allow a prevailing tenant to recover fees even if the lease is silent.\n- Consider sanctions or bad\u2011faith relief. If the landlord\u2019s lawsuit is frivolous or brought in bad faith, a court can sometimes impose sanctions or award fees under its inherent powers or court rules.\n- If you want the right going forward, you can try to negotiate an amendment to the lease making the fee provision reciprocal.\n\nIf you want, paste the exact lease language and tell me what kind of case the landlord brought (nonpayment, holdover, eviction for cause, or tenant counterclaims).

In NYC, organizations like Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC, or community/tenant clinics can help assess whether you might be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under any statute or if you should pursue a frivolous-claim defense.\n- If you already have a case, ask the court about what fees can be claimed and whether any fee-shifting rules or court rules might apply.\n\nIf you want, tell me the exact lease language and what kind of case you\u2019re dealing with (e.g., eviction, harassment, Repairs/habitability, discrimination).

If both are present, a court may refuse to enforce the clause.  \n- Severability/reformation: sometimes the court will strike only the offending clause and enforce the rest of the lease, or reform a clause to make it reasonable rather than void the whole contract.\n\nCommon examples of clauses often rejected in NYC\n- Clauses attempting to waive the implied warranty of habitability or to prevent tenants from asserting habitability defenses in court.  \n- Clauses that authorize landlord self-help eviction (changing locks, removing tenant\u2019s belongings without a court order).

Additionally, under NYC law, certain clauses are specifically prohibited or restricted, such as those that:\n\n* Waive a tenant's rights under the Rent Stabilization Law or the NYC Administrative Code\n* Impose penalties for exercising a tenant's rights\n* Require a tenant to pay rent in a manner that is not specified in the lease\n\nIt's essential to note that a court will review the specific circumstances and facts of the case to determine whether a lease clause is enforceable. If you believe a lease clause is unfair or unenforceable, it's recommended that you consult with a housing law attorney or seek assistance from a qualified tenant's rights organization.",

            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, as in the rest of New York State, lease agreements are generally binding contracts between the landlord and the tenant. However, there are certain provisions that a court may refuse to enforce if they are deemed unconscionable, illegal, or against public policy. Here are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Unconscionability**: A court may refuse to enforce a lease provision if it finds that the clause is unconscionable. This means that the clause is so one-sided or oppressive that it shocks the conscience and is fundamentally unfair. To prove unconscionability, you typically need to show both procedural unconscionability (e.g., lack of meaningful choice, unequal bargaining power) and substantive unconscionability (e.g., the terms are overly harsh or one-sided).\n\n2. **Illegal Provisions**: Any clause that violates New York State or New York City laws will not be enforced by a court. For example, a lease provision that waives your rights under the New York City Housing Maintenance Code or the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law would be illegal and unenforceable.\n\n3. **Against Public Policy**: A court may refuse to enforce a lease provision if it goes against established public policy. For instance, a clause that attempts to limit your right to withhold rent for necessary repairs or to sue your landlord for habitability issues would likely be deemed against public policy.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: If a lease provision is ambiguous, courts will typically interpret it against the interests of the party who drafted the lease (usually the landlord).\n\nIf you believe a clause in your lease is unfair or unenforceable, you should consult with a legal professional or a tenant advocacy organization. They can provide advice tailored to your specific situation and help you understand your rights under New York City and New York State laws.\n\nSome resources for tenants in New York City include:\n- The Legal Aid Society\n- The Legal Hotline for Tenants (provided by Mobilization for Justice)\n- The Metropolitan Council on Housing\n- Housing Court Answers (a project of Legal Services NYC)",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, absolutely. In New York City, a court can and often will refuse to enforce a lease clause that is deemed unfair, illegal, or against public policy. This is a critical protection for tenants, especially given the significant power imbalance that often exists between landlords and tenants.\n\nHere are the primary reasons a court might refuse to enforce a lease clause in NYC:\n\n1.  **Unconscionability (Real Property Law \u00a7 235-c):**\n    This is the most direct answer to \"extremely unfair.\" New York Real Property Law (RPL) \u00a7 235-c specifically allows a court to refuse to enforce an unconscionable lease or any unconscionable clause within a lease.\n    *   **What it means:** A clause is generally considered unconscionable if it is so one-sided, oppressive, and unfair that no reasonable person would agree to it, and no honest person would attempt to enforce it. Courts look at two aspects:\n        *   **Procedural Unconscionability:** How the clause was formed (e.g., unequal bargaining power, hidden terms, complex language, lack of opportunity to understand).\n        *   **Substantive Unconscionability:** The terms of the clause itself (e.g., overly harsh, oppressive, disproportionate, no reasonable commercial purpose).\n    *   **Court's Power:** If a court finds a clause to be unconscionable, it can:\n        *   Refuse to enforce the entire lease.\n        *   Refuse to enforce only the unconscionable clause.\n        *   Limit the application of the unconscionable clause to avoid an unconscionable result.\n\n2.  **Violation of Law or Public Policy:**\n    Many clauses are unenforceable because they attempt to waive rights or impose obligations that are contrary to existing laws or fundamental public policy. This is very common in NYC housing. Examples include:\n    *   **Waiver of Warranty of Habitability (RPL \u00a7 235-b):** Any clause that attempts to make a tenant waive their right to a safe, sanitary, and livable apartment is void and unenforceable.\n    *   **Waiver of Rent Stabilization/ETPA Rights:** In rent-stabilized apartments, any clause that attempts to waive a tenant's rights under the Rent Stabilization Code or the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (ETPA) is void. This includes rights to renewal leases, to challenge rent overcharges, or to succession.\n    *   **Illegal Fees:** Clauses imposing fees not permitted by law (e.g., application fees beyond the legal limit, excessive late fees, move-in/move-out fees not tied to actual services).\n        *   *Note:* Late fees are capped at $50 or 5% of the monthly rent, whichever is less (RPL \u00a7 238-a).\n        *   *Note:* Security deposits are capped at one month's rent (RPL \u00a7 238-a).\n    *   **Indemnification for Landlord's Negligence (General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-321):** A clause that attempts to make a tenant responsible for injuries or damages caused by the landlord's own negligence is void and unenforceable.\n    *   **Attorneys' Fees (RPL \u00a7 234):** If a lease gives the landlord the right to recover attorneys' fees for legal actions, RPL \u00a7 234 automatically creates a reciprocal right for the tenant to recover attorneys' fees if they prevail. Any clause attempting to deny this reciprocal right is unenforceable.\n    *   **Clauses Requiring Tenant to Make Landlord's Repairs:** While tenants are responsible for minor repairs due to their own negligence, clauses that shift the landlord's fundamental responsibility to maintain the premises (e.g., structural repairs, plumbing, heating) to the tenant are generally unenforceable.\n    *   **Waiver of Right to Jury Trial:** While often included, these clauses are sometimes challenged and their enforceability can depend on specific circumstances and the court's interpretation.\n\n3.  **Ambiguity:**\n    If a clause is vague, unclear, or open to multiple interpretations, a court will generally interpret it against the party who drafted the lease (which is almost always the landlord).\n\n**What to Do if You Have Such a Clause:**\n\n1.  **Do Not Assume It's Unenforceable:** While many unfair clauses are indeed unenforceable, you should not unilaterally decide to ignore it.\n2.  **Seek Legal Advice:** The best course of action is to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant's rights organization in NYC. They can review your specific lease clause, explain your rights, and advise you on the likelihood of a court refusing to enforce it.\n3.  **Gather Documentation:** Have your lease readily available for review.\n\nIn summary, NYC law provides significant protections against unfair lease clauses. If you believe a clause in your lease is \"extremely unfair,\" there's a good chance a court would agree and refuse to enforce it, either because it's unconscionable or because it violates specific tenant protection laws.",
            "llama3": "In most jurisdictions, courts will enforce the terms of a valid and legally binding contract, including leases. However, there are some situations where a court might decline to enforce an unfair or unconscionable term.\n\nHere are some possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Unconscionability**: If the clause is extremely one-sided, shocks the conscience, or is so unreasonable that it would cause significant hardship to you, the court might declare it unenforceable as a matter of public policy.\n2. **Public policy violations**: If the clause violates a fundamental public policy or law, such as consumer protection statutes or antidiscrimination laws, the court may refuse to enforce it.\n3. **Illegality**: If the clause is illegal or contravenes a valid and applicable law, the court will not enforce it.\n\nTo challenge an unfair lease clause, you would need to:\n\n1. Consult with a lawyer: Discuss your situation with a knowledgeable attorney who can help you determine if the clause is indeed unfair and whether there are grounds to challenge its enforcement.\n2. Identify relevant laws and regulations: Research the relevant laws, statutes, and regulations in your jurisdiction that might support your case.\n3. Prepare a legal argument: Develop a solid legal argument explaining why the clause is unfair or unconscionable and how it violates public policy or law.\n4. File a lawsuit (if necessary): If you're unable to reach an agreement with your landlord, you may need to file a lawsuit to challenge the enforceability of the clause.\n\nSome examples of potentially unfair lease clauses include:\n\n* A clause requiring you to pay excessive fees for services not provided\n* A clause restricting your right to quiet enjoyment or peaceful occupation of the property\n* A clause that violates antidiscrimination laws or consumer protection statutes\n\nRemember, it's essential to carefully review your lease and understand its terms before signing. If you're unsure about a particular clause, seek legal advice to protect your rights.\n\nIn summary, while courts generally enforce valid contracts, there are situations where they might decline to do so if the clause is deemed unfair or unconscionable. With proper legal guidance and a strong argument, you may be able to challenge an unfair lease clause and seek relief."

        "responses": {
            "gpt-5.1": "In NYC (and all of New York State), whether your landlord has to warn you about an automatic renewal clause depends mainly on:\n\n1. **What kind of lease you have**, and  \n2. **Whether you\u2019re rent-stabilized/regulated or not.**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Market-rate/apartment leases (most private rentals)\n\nFor a typical apartment lease (market-rate, not rent-stabilized), **New York\u2019s \u201cautomatic renewal\u201d disclosure law (GOL \u00a7 5\u2011903)** usually does **not** apply. That statute is aimed at certain service contracts and commercial leases, not standard residential apartment leases.\n\nSo for most NYC tenants in **non-regulated apartments**:\n- If your lease has a clear automatic renewal clause, the landlord generally **does not have to send you a special warning notice** before it renews, unless:\n  - The lease itself **promises** such a notice, or  \n  - You fall under a specific local rule (e.g., a condo/coop house rule or similar) that requires notice.\n\nYou should:\n- Read the clause carefully for:\n  - **How it renews** (same terms vs. month\u2011to\u2011month; rent increases)  \n  - **How and by when you must give notice** if you do **not** want it to renew\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rent-stabilized apartments\n\nIf you are in a **rent-stabilized** apartment (very common in NYC):\n\n- The landlord **must offer you a renewal lease** on the *official DHCR form*.\n- Under the Rent Stabilization Code, the owner must send this **renewal offer**:\n  - **No earlier than 150 days** and  \n  - **No later than 90 days**  \n  before your current lease ends.\n- That renewal form serves as your \u201cwarning\u201d and gives you:\n  - The proposed new rent (per legal guidelines)  \n  - Option of a 1\u2011year or 2\u2011year renewal  \n  - A deadline (typically 60 days) to return it\n\nIf the landlord fails to send a timely renewal offer:\n- You do **not** lose your apartment.\n- Your tenancy continues under the existing terms (other than lawful guideline increases once imposed), and the landlord can\u2019t remove you just because the lease term date passed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Rent-controlled or other regulated situations\n\n- **Rent-controlled** tenants usually don\u2019t have standard fixed-term leases; different rules apply, and \u201cautomatic renewal clauses\u201d typically aren\u2019t the issue.  \n- **Subsidized housing (Section 8, NYCHA, etc.)** may have its own federal/agency notice rules, often requiring recertification and written renewals, but those are program-specific rather than standard \u201cautomatic renewal\u201d warnings.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical steps\n\n1. **Check your lease clause**  \n   Look for wording like:\n   - \u201cThis lease shall automatically renew for an additional term unless\u2026\u201d  \n   - \u201cTenant must give written notice of intent not to renew at least X days before expiration.\u201d\n\n2. **Note the deadline**  \n   Many clauses require **30\u201360 days\u2019 written notice** if you do not want renewal. Miss it, and you may be on the hook for the new term (subject to some equitable defenses, but that can be a fight).\n\n3. **If you\u2019re rent-stabilized**  \n   - Confirm your status (DHCR rent history, prior stabilized riders, etc.).  \n   - Expect the renewal offer **150\u201390 days before** expiration. If you don\u2019t get one, that\u2019s a **landlord violation**, and you should keep paying your legal rent and can complain to DHCR if needed.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether the apartment is **rent-stabilized or market\u2011rate**, and  \n- What the exact lease language says (you can paraphrase or paste it, redacting personal info),\n\nI can explain precisely what obligations your landlord has in your situation and what dates you should be watching.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer\n- If your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized: yes \u2014 the landlord must send you a written renewal offer within a required window before the lease ends (generally 90\u2013150 days before expiration).\n- If it\u2019s a market\u2011rate (non\u2011stabilized) lease: there is no special NYC rule that always requires the landlord to separately \u201cwarn\u201d you about an automatic renewal clause beyond whatever the lease itself says. Your obligations and any notice deadlines will be whatever the lease requires (or any applicable state consumer\u2011contract rules, described below).\n\nMore detail and what you can do\n1) Rent\u2011stabilized apartments (NYC)\n- Landlords must offer a renewal lease in writing during the statutorily required period before the lease expires (commonly described as 90\u2013150 days). The renewal offer must state the proposed rent and other renewal terms. If the owner fails to send the renewal offer as required, you have specific administrative remedies through DHCR/OTDA (you should not simply rely on the auto\u2011renewal clause).\n\n2) Market\u2011rate apartments\n- A standard market lease can include an automatic renewal (month\u2011to\u2011month or another fixed term). Unless the lease or applicable law says otherwise, the landlord does not have a separate statutory duty to give you a warning beyond the contract terms.\n- New York has statutes that regulate some automatic\u2011renewal/continuous\u2011service consumer contracts (requiring a clear notice within a certain time frame before renewal and an easy cancellation method). Those laws usually target services and subscriptions; whether they apply to a particular residential lease can depend on the facts. In many cases residential leases are treated differently from consumer subscription contracts.\n\nPractical steps\n- Read your lease carefully for: the automatic\u2011renewal clause, any required tenant notice to avoid renewal (for example \u201ctenant must give X days\u2019 written notice before the end of the term\u201d), and any timing requirements.\n- If you don\u2019t want the renewal to take effect, give written (preferably certified mail / email and keep proof) notice of non\u2011renewal in whatever time the lease requires. If the lease is silent, a 30\u2011day written notice before the end of the term is commonly used for month\u2011to\u2011month situations.\n- If you are rent\u2011stabilized and didn\u2019t receive the required renewal offer, you can contact DHCR or a housing attorney for help.\n- If you want, tell me whether your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized and when the lease ends; I can check what the lease likely requires and draft a short non\u2011renewal letter you can use.\n\nIf you want a template notice or want me to check whether state automatic\u2011renewal law applies to your lease, send the lease clause or tell me whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized and the lease end date.",

For specifics, you can contact NYC DHCR or a tenants\u2019 rights clinic.\n\n- If your unit is not rent-stabilized:\n  - There is no statutory renewal-notice requirement. The automatic renewal clause is a contractual term.\n  - Your lease will renew automatically under the clause unless you give the notice required by the lease to non-renew (often a 30\u201360 day notice before expiration, but check your lease).\n\nWhat you should do:\n- Check if your building is rent-stabilized (or rent-controlled). The lease or your rent history with DHCR can confirm this.\n- If stabilized, look for the renewal offer in writing and note the expiration date and the renewal window (90\u2013150 days before expiration).\n- If not stabilized, read your lease for the notice to terminate or not-renew requirements.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Is the unit rent-stabilized or rent-controlled (if you\u2019re not sure, we can check the DHCR records)?\n- What is your current lease expiration date?\n- What does your lease say about renewal and notice?\n\nI can help interpret the specific clauses and what steps you should take next.",

How long do they have to return the fully executed lease?**\n\nUnder the NYC Rent Stabilization Code:\n\n- Your landlord must give you a renewal lease between **90 and 150 days** before your current lease expires (usually on an RTP\u20118 form).\n- After you sign and return it, they\u2019re supposed to **return a fully executed copy within 30 days** of receiving your signed renewal.\n\nIf they delay:\n\n- The legal rent\u2011increase date can be affected:  \n  - If they return it late, the increase may only become collectible **from the date they actually return the fully executed renewal**, not from the original renewal start date.  \n  - DHCR (the state agency) has long taken the position that a landlord who doesn\u2019t comply with the timelines can\u2019t charge the higher rent until they do.\n\n**b. Do you have to pay the increased rent before you get the executed lease?**\n\n- You are **not required to pay the increased rent until you have a proper renewal lease** and it has commenced.\n- If:\n  - The landlord didn\u2019t offer the renewal on time, or  \n  - They didn\u2019t return the fully executed lease in a timely way,  \n  you can usually **continue paying your current legal rent** until:\n  - You receive the fully executed renewal, and  \n  - The renewal term begins (and sometimes, depending on timing, until the date they actually return it).\n\nIf the landlord later returns the lease and tries to back\u2011bill you:\n\n- They may be limited in **how far back** they can collect the increase, depending on whether the delay was their fault.\n- You can file a complaint with DHCR:  \n  - \u201cFailure to Renew Lease\u201d (RA\u201190) or  \n  - \u201cTenant\u2019s Complaint of Owner\u2019s Failure to Renew Lease and/or Failure to Furnish a Copy of a Signed Lease\u201d (RA\u201190\u2011related forms).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Non\u2011regulated (market\u2011rate or not rent\u2011stabilized) apartments\n\nThere\u2019s no specific NYC statute that sets a deadline for the landlord to return a fully executed renewal lease in a market\u2011rate apartment.\n\nInstead:\n\n- It\u2019s treated as a contract: once you\u2019ve been offered a renewal, you sign it, and they accept by countersigning and/or continuing the tenancy at the new terms.\n- The law doesn\u2019t give a precise number of days for them to return the signed copy.\n\n**Paying the new rent in this situation:**\n\n- If you\u2019ve **signed a renewal agreeing to the higher rent**, the landlord can generally expect you to pay the new rent from the start date listed, **even if they\u2019ve been slow returning their copy**.\n- Practically, many tenants:\n  - Ask in writing for a countersigned copy;  \n  - Pay the old rent until they receive it, or  \n  - Pay the new rent but note in writing that it\u2019s pursuant to the renewal you signed on X date and that you\u2019re still requesting a fully executed copy.\n\nBecause this is more about contract and proof than a specific rent\u2011stabilization rule, what\u2019s best depends on your risk tolerance and relationship with your landlord.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What you should do now\n\nTo give you a precise answer tailored to your situation, I\u2019d need to know:\n\n1. Is your apartment **rent\u2011stabilized**? (You can often tell from receiving DHCR rent\u2011stabilized rider forms, RTP\u20118 renewal forms, or by checking with DHCR.)\n2. When did:\n   - Your current lease start and end?  \n   - You receive the renewal offer?  \n   - You sign and return the renewal?\n3. Has the new lease term already started?\n\nIf you tell me those, I can say:\n\n- Exactly whether you must pay the increased rent now, and  \n- From what date the landlord can legally collect the increase.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer\n- If you signed and returned a renewal, that acceptance is binding on you \u2014 you are expected to pay the renewed rent once the new lease term starts even if the landlord hasn\u2019t yet given you a countersigned/\u201cfully executed\u201d copy.  \n- There is no useful benefit to withholding the increased rent just because you haven\u2019t received the landlord\u2019s signature; doing so risks a late/rent-demand or even a holdover eviction.  \n- The landlord should promptly return a fully executed copy; if they don\u2019t, demand one in writing, keep proof of your signed offer and all communications, and consider contacting a tenant advice agency or an attorney.\n\nExplanation and practical steps\n1) Binding acceptance and payment\n- When you sign and return a renewal offer you have accepted the terms. That acceptance creates the new lease obligations as of the renewal\u2019s start date. Not having the landlord\u2019s countersignature does not generally excuse you from paying the rent that you agreed to.  \n- To avoid giving the landlord a basis to begin a nonpayment eviction, pay the new rent when it\u2019s due unless you have a separate, documented legal reason not to (for example, a successful rent-overcharge proceeding that establishes a different amount).\n\n2) Reasonable time to return a fully executed copy\n- NYC practice (and common lease law) expects the landlord to return a countersigned copy promptly. There is no single statutory \u201cX days\u201d deadline that applies to all NYC residential renewals that would let you lawfully stop paying if the landlord delays. What\u2019s \u201cprompt\u201d will depend on facts, but 7\u201330 days after receiving your signed copy is commonly reasonable. If the landlord delays longer, put a written demand (certified mail or email with read receipt) asking for the executed copy and keep proof of that demand.\n\n3) What to do if the landlord won\u2019t return it or delays\n- Send a written request for a fully executed copy and keep proof (photos/scans of your signed lease, mail receipts, emails).  \n- Continue to pay the rent the renewal specifies when due. If you must dispute the increase later (e.g., rent-stabilized overcharge), you can preserve your defense and seek a refund or credit later.  \n- If the landlord retaliates or attempts eviction for nonpayment, your signed renewal is an important document to present in court. If your building/unit is rent-stabilized and the landlord refuses to honor proper renewal procedures, contact DHCR (NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal) or a tenant attorney/advocate.  \n- If you want, you can pay \u201cunder protest\u201d (write that on the check or include a written statement) and keep records; that preserves the ability to challenge the amount later while avoiding eviction risk.\n\nIf you want more specific guidance\n- Tell me whether the apartment is rent-stabilized or market-rate and the dates involved (when you signed/returned the renewal and when the new term starts). I can draft a short written demand for the fully executed lease and tell you what evidence to keep and where to complain if the landlord refuses.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer (in practice for rent-stabilized units in NYC):\n- How long the landlord has to return a fully executed renewal lease: Typically up to 60 days after you sign the renewal. If they don\u2019t return a countersigned copy within about 60 days, you can contact DHCR and/or seek legal help to enforce the renewal terms.\n- Do you have to pay the rent increase before you get the fully executed lease: No. The new rent amount in the renewal typically becomes due only when the renewal term starts and the renewal is properly executed (i.e., both parties have signed). If you haven\u2019t received a fully executed renewal showing the new rent and start date, you should continue paying the current rent. If you\u2019ve already paid the higher amount without a countersigned renewal, you may request a credit or refund and should document the situation.\n\nImportant caveats:\n- This guidance mainly applies to rent-stabilized (and sometimes rent-controlled) apartments. If your building is not rent-stabilized, there isn\u2019t the same statutory deadline, though your lease renewal terms (including any increase) still govern what you owe.\n- Start and end dates matter: the renewal\u2019s start date in the lease controls when any rent increase takes effect. If the renewal is not fully executed, you generally stay on the current terms until a valid renewal is in place.\n\nWhat you can do now:\n- Confirm whether your apartment is rent-stabilized (you can check your current lease, your building\u2019s status with the DHCR, or ask me to help you look up the status).\n- Ask your landlord in writing for a promptly countersigned renewal lease and confirm the renewal start date and new rent amount.\n- Do not sign or pay the increased rent until you have a fully executed renewal showing the new terms.\n- If the landlord misses the 60-day window, you can file a DHCR complaint or seek legal assistance.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Is your apartment rent-stabilized?\n- What is the renewal start date and the proposed new rent?\n- Have you already paid any increased rent or not received a countersigned copy?\n\nI can tailor a brief letter to your landlord and point you to the right DHCR resources.",

If it's been longer than that, it's reasonable to follow up in writing (email is good) to request your copy.\n    *   **Your Protection:** Keep a copy of the renewal offer you signed and returned to the landlord. This is your proof that you accepted the renewal.\n\n2.  **Do I have to pay the rent increase before I get it?**\n    *   **Yes, generally you do.** The new rent amount, as stated in the renewal offer you signed, becomes effective on the **start date of the new lease term**, regardless of whether you have received the fully executed copy yet.\n    *   Your obligation to pay the new rent begins on that date because you accepted the terms of the renewal offer. The physical return of the landlord's signed copy is a formality to complete your records, but it doesn't change the effective date of the new lease term or the rent increase.\n\n**Key Takeaways & What to Do:**\n\n*   **Keep Records:** Always make a copy of any lease renewal offer you sign and return to your landlord. This is crucial proof of your acceptance.\n*   **Follow Up:** If you haven't received your fully executed lease within a reasonable time (e.g., 3-4 weeks), send a polite written request to your landlord or management company asking for it.\n*   **Pay the New Rent:** Be prepared to pay the increased rent starting from the effective date of your new lease term.\n*   **If Your Apartment is NOT Rent-Stabilized:** If your apartment is market-rate, the rules are different. Landlords are not required to offer renewals, and the terms are entirely negotiable. However, if they *did* offer a renewal and you signed it, the principles of contract law would still apply, meaning your acceptance generally forms a binding agreement, and the new rent would be due on the new lease term's start date.\n\nIf you encounter significant delays or issues, you can contact NYS Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR), which oversees rent-stabilized apartments, or seek advice from a housing attorney or tenant advocacy group.",

Holdover/renewal rules can be different, and the landlord may need to follow specific steps to end the tenancy or to set a new rent.\n- If there was never consent to stay (landlord never accepted rent after the term, or you signed a new written agreement that changes the status), the situation could be different. But in most cases where the landlord kept taking rent, you\u2019re treated as month-to-month.\n\nWhat you should do now\n- Check if the apartment is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled. If so, look up the protections that apply to stabilizations.\n- Decide whether you want to stay longer or move. If you want to stay, you can negotiate a new, written lease with the landlord (often a new fixed term) or continue on a month-to-month basis with a written notice about terms.\n- If you want to leave, give the landlord written notice at least 30 days before you plan to move (the exact notice period is generally 30 days for a month-to-month tenancy).\n- Keep records: save copies of all rent payments, notices, and any communications with the landlord.\n- If the landlord tries to evict you or denies you the right to stay after a proper 30-day notice, consider consulting an attorney or a tenant-rights clinic for help with a holdover/eviction proceeding.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Is the unit rent-stabilized or rent-controlled?\n- How long have you been in the unit after the lease ended?\n- Have you received any written notices from the landlord about leaving or renewing?\n\nI can tailor the guidance to your situation and point you to NYC resources for free or low-cost legal help.",

This new tenancy is typically on a month-to-month basis.\n\n2.  **Terms of the Tenancy:** The terms and conditions of your expired lease usually carry over to the month-to-month tenancy, except for the duration. This means the rent amount, rules, and responsibilities generally remain the same.\n\n3.  **Termination of Month-to-Month Tenancy:**\n    *   **By You (the Tenant):** You typically need to give your landlord at least one month's written notice before the end of a rental period (e.g., if your rent is due on the 1st, you'd give notice by May 1st to vacate by May 31st).\n    *   **By Your Landlord:** This is where NYC law, particularly the **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)**, is very specific. The required notice period for your landlord to terminate your month-to-month tenancy (or to not renew a lease) depends on how long you've lived in the apartment:\n        *   **Less than 1 year:** Landlord must give at least **30 days' written notice**.\n        *   **Between 1 and 2 years:** Landlord must give at least **60 days' written notice**.\n        *   **More than 2 years:** Landlord must give at least **90 days' written notice**.\n        This notice must be in writing and delivered appropriately.\n\n4.  **Crucial Exception: Rent-Stabilized or Rent-Controlled Apartments:**\n    If your apartment is **rent-stabilized or rent-controlled**, the situation is different and your rights are much stronger. In these cases, your landlord **cannot** simply convert you to a month-to-month tenant after your lease expires. They are legally obligated to offer you a renewal lease (typically for a one- or two-year term) at a legally permissible rent increase set by the Rent Guidelines Board. If they fail to offer a renewal, you still have the right to remain in the apartment under the terms of the expired lease, and you are considered a \"statutory tenant\" with the right to a renewal lease.\n\n**In summary:** For a market-rate apartment, yes, accepting rent after a lease ends generally makes you a month-to-month tenant. For a rent-stabilized or rent-controlled apartment, your landlord must offer a renewal lease, and you have stronger protections against being converted to month-to-month.\n\n**It's always advisable to consult with a housing attorney or tenant rights organization in NYC to understand your specific rights and options.**",

While it's not necessarily a straightforward situation, here's what you should know:\n\n1. **Month-to-Month Tenancy**: When a tenancy continues without a new written agreement after the initial lease term ends, it may be considered a month-to-month tenancy. This means the tenant (you) and landlord are agreeing to continue the tenancy on a monthly basis, with rent being paid on a month-by-month basis.\n2. **Your Intentions**: If you intended to stay in the rental unit only temporarily or until you found another place to live, it's possible that your landlord considered you a month-to-month tenant. However, if you had no intention of leaving and continued paying rent as if you were still under the original lease terms, this might be viewed differently.\n3. **Your Landlord's Actions**: Your landlord taking your rent without establishing a new written agreement may indicate that they considered you a month-to-month tenant. This is because landlords often require a new, written agreement (usually in the form of a month-to-month lease or renewal) to continue collecting rent after the initial lease term ends.\n4. **Your Rights and Responsibilities**: As a de facto month-to-month tenant, your rights and responsibilities may be different from those under your original lease. You may have limited notice requirements for terminating the tenancy (typically 30 days), but you'll still need to provide written notice to your landlord.\n\nTo clarify your situation, it's recommended that you:\n\n1. Review your original lease agreement: Check if there are any provisions related to extending or renewing the lease.\n2. Confirm with your landlord: Ask your landlord what their understanding is regarding your tenancy after the initial lease term ended.\n3. Consider a written agreement: If you want to continue renting the unit, consider negotiating a new written month-to-month lease or renewal agreement with your landlord.\n\nRemember that rental laws and regulations vary by state and locality, so it's essential to understand your specific situation and the rules governing your tenancy."

If you have a fixed-term lease, the landlord generally must wait until the lease ends.\n\nImportant exceptions and limitations\n- Rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled apartments: those tenants have stronger protections \u2014 the landlord generally cannot simply end the tenancy without a legal basis and must follow special rules (renewal offers, approved grounds for nonrenewal, etc.).  \n- Retaliation and discrimination: a landlord may not terminate tenancy for a retaliatory or discriminatory reason (for example, because you complained to HPD, asserted tenant rights, joined a tenants\u2019 group, or because of your protected class). Such notices can be challenged.  \n- Proper service and court process: even with proper notice, a landlord cannot legally force you out without bringing a holdover eviction in court and getting a judgment. A simple verbal demand to leave is not enough.\n\nWhat you should do\n1. Ask for the termination in writing and for the date they want you out.  \n2. Check whether you have a lease or whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized (look up the building/unit on NYC HPD/DHCR).  \n3. Do not move out until the written notice period expires (and don\u2019t leave valuable property behind).  \n4.

This means a landlord usually **cannot simply tell you to leave without providing a legally recognized reason.**\n\n**What constitutes \"Good Cause\"?** Examples include:\n*   Non-payment of rent\n*   Violating a substantial obligation of your tenancy (e.g., consistently disturbing other tenants, illegal activity)\n*   Using the unit for illegal purposes\n*   Willfully damaging the apartment\n*   The landlord seeking to recover the apartment for their own primary residence or that of a family member (under specific conditions)\n*   Demolition of the building\n*   Withdrawal of the unit from the rental market\n\n**However, there are important exceptions to the Good Cause Eviction law:**\n\nThe Good Cause Eviction law **does NOT apply** to certain types of housing, including:\n*   **Owner-occupied buildings with three or fewer units.** If your landlord lives in the same building and there are three or fewer apartments total, they might be exempt.\n*   Units where the rent is 300% or more of the fair market rent for the area (a very high threshold).\n*   Units subject to rent control or rent stabilization (these have their own, even stronger, protections).\n*   Units where the tenant is an employee of the landlord.\n*   Units in co-ops or condominiums.\n\n**Therefore:**\n*   **If your building is NOT exempt from Good Cause Eviction:** Your landlord **must have a legally recognized reason** to terminate your month-to-month tenancy.

When your landlord wants to terminate a month-to-month tenancy, they typically must provide written notice that complies with state law.\n\n**Is it allowed for a month-to-month tenancy in the City?**\n\nYes, your landlord can terminate a month-to-month tenancy without cause (i.e., without giving a reason) if they follow the proper procedure. This is known as \"termination by notice\" or \"month-to-month termination.\"\n\n**How much notice do they need to provide?**\n\nFor a month-to-month tenancy in California, your landlord must provide at least 30 days' written notice to terminate the tenancy. This means that if you receive a notice from your landlord stating that they want you to vacate the premises within 14 days, for example, it's likely not valid.\n\nThe notice period is calculated from the date of delivery or mailing of the notice, not from the effective date of termination (i.e., the last day of the tenancy).\n\n**Some key points to keep in mind:**\n\n1. The notice must be in writing and signed by your landlord or authorized agent.\n2. The notice should specify the exact date of termination, which is typically 30 days after delivery or mailing.\n3.

If your landlord wants to terminate for a specific reason (e.g., violating the lease), they must provide a separate written notice that complies with California Civil Code Section 1946.\n\n**What can you do next?**\n\nIf you've received a termination notice without a specified reason, you have several options:\n\n1. Review the notice carefully: Make sure it complies with California law regarding month-to-month terminations.\n2. Verify your rights: Check your lease agreement or any other written agreements related to your tenancy.\n3. Negotiate: If you're willing to stay, try negotiating a new lease or modification of the existing one.\n4. Seek legal advice: Consult with an attorney specializing in landlord-tenant law to determine your best course of action.\n\nRemember, if you have questions or concerns about your specific situation, it's always a good idea to consult with a qualified attorney or local housing authority for guidance."

If you are still under a fixed-term lease, the landlord cannot raise your rent until the lease term expires.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- whether your current lease is month-to-month or a fixed lease,\n- how long you\u2019ve lived there,\n- and whether you know if the unit is rent\u2011stabilized.\n\nI can help you review the notice language and explain your options or point you to local tenant assistance resources.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: Yes, a landlord can raise the rent on a month-to-month tenancy, but they must follow the law. They can\u2019t just impose a higher rent without giving you proper notice. Whether the increase is legal or not also depends on whether your apartment is rent-stabilized/regulated.\n\nKey points\n\n- Non-regulated (unregulated) apartments in NYC:\n  - The landlord can increase the rent on a month-to-month tenancy.\n  - They must give you proper written notice of the rent increase. For a monthly rent, that notice is typically 30 days before the increase takes effect.\n  - You don\u2019t have to sign a new lease for the increase to take effect\u2014if you continue paying the higher rent after the notice date, you\u2019re agreeing to it by staying.\n  - If you don\u2019t want to pay the higher rent, you can move out by the end of the current rental period as long as you provide the required notice.\n\n- Rent-stabilized / rent-controlled apartments:\n  - In stabilized/controlled units, increases aren\u2019t set by the tenant unilaterally. Increases are governed by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n  - When a lease ends, stabilized tenants typically receive a renewal lease with a legally allowed increase. You can choose to sign the renewal or continue on a month-to-month basis with the regulated rent (often higher than your old lease but within guidelines).\n  - A landlord cannot legally raise rent beyond the established guidelines or impose a unilateral increase outside the renewal process. If you\u2019re told to pay more than the guideline amount, that can be illegal and you should seek help (DHCR, legal aid, or a lawyer).\n\nWhat to do now\n\n- Check if your unit is rent-stabilized or controlled:\n  - Look at your current rent history, ask the landlord for the rent registration, or check with NYC DHCR (the Rent Guidelines Board and DHCR websites have tools to verify stabilization status).\n- If you\u2019re not stabilized:\n  - Request in writing the exact new rent amount, the date it goes into effect, and the notice given. Confirm how the increased rent will affect you.\n  - Decide whether you want to accept the increase, negotiate, or move.\n- If you think the unit might be stabilized:\n  - Do not assume you can be treated like an unregulated unit. Get a determination from DHCR or a qualified attorney.\n- If you\u2019re unsure or feel the notice wasn\u2019t proper:\n  - Consider contacting a tenants\u2019 rights group, legal aid, or a housing attorney for advice specific to your building.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Is your building likely rent-stabilized (unit count, year built, prior renewal practices, etc.)?\n- What is the current rent and the proposed new rent?\n- How long is your current tenancy, and what notice did they give?\n\nI can tailor guidance and help you draft a response or a plan based on NYC rules. Note: I\u2019m not your lawyer; for legal advice, contact a qualified attorney or a tenants\u2019 rights clinic.",
            "Llama 4 Scout": "According to NYC law, a landlord can raise the rent on a month-to-month lease, but there are specific requirements they must follow. \n\nUnder the NYC Rent Stabilization Law, a landlord can increase the rent on a month-to-month lease by giving the tenant a written notice of the rent increase at least 30 days before the increase takes effect. The notice must be in a specific form and include the amount of the rent increase and the date it will take effect.\n\nHowever, the rent increase is subject to certain limitations. If the apartment is subject to rent stabilization, the landlord can only charge a rent increase that is approved by the NYC Rent Guidelines Board (RGB). The RGB sets the allowable rent increases annually, and landlords can only charge the approved increase.\n\nIf the apartment is not subject to rent stabilization, the landlord can raise the rent by any amount, but they must still provide the 30-day written notice.\n\nIt's essential to review your lease agreement and check if your apartment is subject to rent stabilization to understand your rights and the limitations on rent increases.

            "Mistral on-site": "In New York City, whether a landlord can raise the rent on a month-to-month lease without the tenant's agreement depends on several factors, primarily whether the apartment is rent-stabilized or not.\n\n1. **Rent-Stabilized Apartments**: If your apartment is rent-stabilized, the landlord must follow specific rules set by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). Generally, the landlord can only increase the rent once every 12 months and must provide a 30-day notice for a rent increase of less than 5% or a 60-day notice for a rent increase of 5% or more. The increase must also comply with the guidelines set by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n\n2. **Market-Rate (Unregulated) Apartments**: If your apartment is not rent-stabilized, the landlord can generally raise the rent with proper notice. The notice period depends on the length of the tenancy:\n   - For tenancies of less than one year, a 30-day notice is required.\n   - For tenancies of one year or more, a 60-day notice is required.\n   - For tenancies of more than one year but less than two years, a 90-day notice is required.\n   - For tenancies of two years or more, a 120-day notice is required.\n\nHowever, even for market-rate apartments, the rent increase must be reasonable and cannot be retaliatory or discriminatory.\n\nIf you believe the rent increase is illegal or improper, you can file a complaint with the DHCR or consult with a legal aid organization or a private attorney who specializes in housing law. It's always a good idea to document all communications with your landlord and keep records of your lease and any notices received.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, you should contact the DHCR or consult with a housing attorney.",

Rent increases are strictly limited by the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) and other regulations. They must offer you a renewal lease, and any increase must be within the legal limits. You would not be on a true \"month-to-month\" lease in the same way a free-market tenant would be; you'd have rights to a renewal lease.\n    *   **If your apartment is NOT rent-stabilized or rent-controlled (i.e., \"free market\"):** This is where the landlord has more flexibility, but still must follow specific notice rules.\n\n2.  **For Free Market Month-to-Month Leases:**\n\n    *   **Notice Requirements:** Your landlord *must* provide you with written notice of a rent increase. The amount of notice required depends on how long you've lived in the apartment and the percentage of the rent increase:\n        *   **If you have occupied the unit for less than one year:** The landlord must give you at least **30 days' written notice** before the rent increase takes effect.\n        *   **If you have occupied the unit for one year or more, but less than two years:** The landlord must give you at least **60 days' written notice** before the rent increase takes effect.\n        *   **If you have occupied the unit for two years or more:** The landlord must give you at least **90 days' written notice** before the rent increase takes effect.\n        *   **Important Note:** These notice periods apply to *any* rent increase, but are particularly relevant for increases of **5% or more**. If the increase is less than 5%, the landlord still needs to give reasonable notice, but the specific statutory periods above are triggered by the 5% threshold or by the landlord's decision to terminate the tenancy.\n\n    *   **\"Without Your Agreement\" - What it Means:**\n        *   The landlord *proposes* the new rent by giving you proper notice.\n        *   You don't have to *sign* anything to agree. Your \"agreement\" is implied by your actions.\n        *   **Your options are:**\n            1.  **Accept the new rent:** If you stay in the apartment past the effective date of the increase and pay the new, higher rent, you are deemed to have agreed to the new terms.\n            2.  **Negotiate:** You can try to negotiate with your landlord for a lower increase, but they are not legally obligated to agree.\n            3.  **Move out:** If you do not agree to the new rent, you must vacate the apartment by the effective date of the rent increase. If you stay and refuse to pay the new rent, the landlord can start an eviction proceeding against you for non-payment of rent.\n\n**In summary:** For a free-market month-to-month lease in NYC, your landlord *can* raise your rent by providing proper written notice. You don't have to explicitly agree in writing, but if you remain in the apartment and pay the new rent, you are considered to have accepted the new terms. If you don't accept, your recourse is to move out.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1.  **Check if your apartment is rent-stabilized:** You can do this by checking your lease, asking your landlord, or contacting the NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) at 718-739-6400 or visiting their website.\n2.  **Review the notice:** Make sure the landlord provided the correct amount of written notice based on how long you've lived there.\n3.  **Consider your options:** Decide if you want to pay the new rent, try to negotiate, or look for a new place.\n\nIf you have any doubts or believe your rights are being violated, it's always a good idea to consult with a housing attorney or tenant advocacy group in NYC.",
            "llama3": "In most jurisdictions, a landlord can't unilaterally (without your consent) increase the rent on a month-to-month lease. The specifics of the notice period and procedures vary by state or locality, but generally, you have some protections.\n\nHere are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Notice requirement**: Your landlord typically needs to provide you with written notice of the rent increase, stating the new rent amount and the effective date of the change. This notice period may be 30, 60, or 90 days, depending on your local laws.\n2. **Consent required**: For a month-to-month lease, your landlord usually needs to obtain your consent before increasing the rent. If you refuse to agree to the new rent, they might try to negotiate alternative terms or explore other options, such as terminating the lease and giving you notice to vacate.\n3. **Local laws and regulations**: Rent control laws, ordinances, or state statutes may apply in your area. These laws can limit how much a landlord can increase rent, and some jurisdictions have specific procedures for implementing rent hikes.\n\nTo protect yourself, consider the following:\n\n1. **Review your lease agreement**: Check your month-to-month lease to see if it contains any provisions regarding rent increases.\n2. **Understand local laws and regulations**: Familiarize yourself with the rent control or stabilization laws in your area, as these can impact your landlord's ability to raise the rent.\n3. **Negotiate or seek mediation**: If you're unwilling to accept the proposed rent increase, try negotiating with your landlord to find a mutually acceptable solution. Alternatively, consider seeking mediation through a local housing counseling agency or non-profit organization.\n\nRemember that if you're unable to come to an agreement with your landlord and they choose not to renew your lease, you'll typically receive a certain amount of notice (e.g., 30 days) before the end of the lease term."

Challenging the rent to the state (HCR/Rent Guidelines)\n\n**Overcharge / illegal rent complaint (HCR Form RA\u201189):**\n- **Lookback period:** HCR (NYS Homes and Community Renewal) generally looks back **6 years** from the date you file the complaint to determine legal rent and overcharges.  \n- **When to file:** There is no short \u201c30\u2011day\u201d type deadline; you can file as soon as you suspect an overcharge or illegal increase.  \n- **Effect of waiting:** You don\u2019t lose your right to complain if you wait more than a year, but you can only recover for the 6 years before you file. So the longer you wait, the more older overcharges become unrecoverable.\n\n**Challenge of Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI) increases, MCIs, etc.:**\n- These are also generally raised through an overcharge/incorrect rent complaint or by answering an owner\u2019s application.  \n- Again, the **6\u2011year lookback** limits how far back HCR will recalculate the rent, not how long you \u201chave\u201d to complain.\n\n### 2.

This means if you file a complaint today, DHCR (Division of Housing and Community Renewal) or the courts will calculate any overcharges and award you damages for the past six years.\n\n2.  **Ability to Examine Entire Rent History:** A significant change under HSTPA is that DHCR and the courts are now permitted to examine the **entire rent history** of an apartment, going back beyond the six-year look-back period, to determine the apartment's *legal regulated rent* and whether a fraudulent scheme to deregulate or overcharge existed. This is crucial because it allows the authorities to establish the correct base rent, even if the initial illegal increase happened more than six years ago.\n\n3.  **Fraud Exception:** If the landlord engaged in a **fraudulent scheme** to deregulate the apartment or to charge an illegal rent, there is generally **no statute of limitations** for determining the *legal regulated rent*. In such cases, DHCR or the courts can go back indefinitely to establish the true legal rent. While the recovery of monetary damages might still be limited to the six-year period preceding the complaint, the ability to correct the legal rent going forward is invaluable.\n\n**How to Challenge:**\n\n*   **File a Rent Overcharge Complaint (Form RA-89) with DHCR:** This is the most common way to challenge an illegal rent increase in a rent-regulated apartment.\n*   **Raise it as a Defense or Counterclaim in Housing Court:** If your landlord sues you (e.g., for non-payment of rent), you can raise the illegal rent increase as a defense or file a counterclaim for rent overcharge.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nWhile you can generally only recover money for overcharges within the last six years, the law now allows for a much deeper look into the apartment's rent history to determine the *correct legal rent* and to uncover fraudulent practices, which can have a significant impact on your future rent.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nIf you believe you've been subjected to an illegal rent increase, it's highly recommended to consult with a tenant attorney or a legal aid organization specializing in housing law.

The maximum annual rent increase is determined by the Rent Guidelines Board (R.G.B.), which is an independent body that sets the limits for rent increases in stabilized apartments.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Rent Guidelines Board**: The R.G.B. is a 14-member board composed of representatives from various stakeholders, including:\n\t* Tenants' organizations\n\t* Landlords' organizations\n\t* Rent regulators (e.g., the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development)\n\t* Government officials\n2. **Annual Rent Guidelines Hearings**: The R.G.B. holds public hearings each year to discuss potential rent increases. During these hearings, landlords, tenants, and other stakeholders present their views on what constitutes a reasonable rent increase.\n3. **Rent Increase Determination**: After considering the input from all parties, the R.G.B. votes on a proposed rent increase percentage. This percentage is applied to the stabilized rents in effect at the time of the hearing.\n4. **Maximum Rent Increase**: The resulting maximum rent increase is then implemented for all rent-stabilized apartments in New York City.\n\nFor example, if the R.G.B. sets a 3% rent increase, your landlord can only raise your rent by up to 3% over the previous year's rent.\n\nKeep in mind that while the Rent Guidelines Board determines the maximum rent increase, individual landlords may choose to impose smaller or larger increases within the allowed range. If you have concerns about a proposed rent increase, you should speak with your landlord and/or seek guidance from a tenant rights organization."

In a rent\u2011stabilized building a landlord cannot unilaterally raise your rent just because they replace a boiler or install new building equipment. To increase stabilized rents for building\u2011wide work the landlord must use the Major Capital Improvement (MCI) process and get approval from New York State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR). \n\nWhat that means in practice\n- Qualifying work: Replacing a boiler or installing new central systems can qualify as a Major Capital Improvement if it is a capital item (not routine maintenance) that materially prolongs the building\u2019s useful life or substantially benefits tenants. Routine repairs normally do not qualify.  \n- Formal application required: The landlord must file an MCI petition with HCR (formerly DHCR). They cannot simply add a surcharge to your rent without that filing and approval.  \n- Tenants\u2019 rights: Tenants must be notified and have the right to review the application, request documentation (invoices, contracts, permits), and challenge the MCI if they believe the work does not qualify or the costs are improper. There is a time window to object \u2014 HCR procedures allow tenant challenges.  \n- If approved: An approved MCI results in a lawful additional rent component (and it\u2019s typically calculated and amortized according to HCR rules). The increase is not imposed unless and until HCR approves the petition.  \n- Ordinary lease renewals: MCI increases are in addition to any regular rent\u2011stabilized renewal increases set by the Rent Guidelines Board; landlords still must offer renewal leases under rent\u2011stabilization rules.\n\nWhat you can do now\n1. Confirm you are in a rent\u2011stabilized apartment (look at your lease and renewal offer).  \n2. Ask the landlord in writing if they filed an MCI with HCR and request a copy of the filing, contracts, invoices and permits for the work.  \n3. If you receive notice of an MCI filing or a rent increase, contact HCR and/or a tenants\u2019 rights attorney or a legal services organization right away to learn how to object.  \n4. If services (heat, hot water, elevator, etc.) are interrupted, report deficiencies to 311 and keep records/photos \u2014 separate rules require landlords to maintain services.\n\nIf you want, tell me (a) whether your unit is rent\u2011stabilized, (b) whether you received any notice or rent\u2011increase information, and (c) what work is being done \u2014 I can help draft a request for documents or point you to the right HCR forms and local tenant help lines.",

The cost is spread across all rent-stabilized units in the building.\n- The landlord cannot unilaterally raise your rent for this work. They must file for an MCI with the DHCR and obtain an approved MCI rent increase order.\n- If approved, you\u2019ll see a monthly MCI charge added to your rent, and this charge is paid for the life of the improvement (the amortization period, typically many years, often around 20 years).

Individual Apartment Improvements (IAI) are improvements done in a specific unit and can be charged to that unit (often with the tenant\u2019s consent and a separate DHCR order). IAIs do not apply to the whole building.\n- Not all building work qualifies as an MCI. The work must be a major capital improvement that increases the building\u2019s value and extends its life; ordinary maintenance and repairs do not qualify.\n- Only rent-stabilized units are affected by MCI charges.

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, your landlord *can potentially* raise your rent for building-wide work like replacing a boiler or installing new equipment in a rent-stabilized building, but it's subject to very specific rules and requires approval from the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR). This type of rent increase is known as a **Major Capital Improvement (MCI)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how MCIs work in NYC rent-stabilized buildings, especially after the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA):\n\n1.  **What Qualifies as an MCI?**\n    *   The improvement must be building-wide and benefit all tenants.\n    *   It must be a permanent improvement, not a repair or routine maintenance.\n    *   Examples include:\n        *   New boiler or heating system\n        *   New roof\n        *   New windows\n        *   Elevator modernization\n        *   New intercom or security system\n        *   Rewiring of the building's electrical system\n        *   Installation of new energy-efficient equipment\n\n2.  **DHCR Approval is Required:**\n    *   Your landlord cannot simply raise your rent for these improvements. They must file an application with the DHCR, providing detailed documentation of the work, its cost, and proof that it's a capital improvement and not a repair.\n    *   Tenants have the right to object to the MCI application. The DHCR will notify tenants, and you'll have an opportunity to submit comments or evidence (e.g., that the work was shoddy, unnecessary, or merely a repair).\n\n3.  **Key Changes Post-HSTPA (2019):**\n    *   **Temporary Increase:** This is the most significant change. MCI rent increases are no longer permanent. They are now **temporary** and expire after **30 years**. After 30 years, the portion of your rent attributable to the MCI must be removed.\n    *   **2% Cap:** The annual rent increase from an MCI is capped at **2% of your current rent**. If the calculated increase is higher than 2%, the remainder is carried forward and applied in future years, but still subject to the 2% annual cap. This means it could take several years for the full MCI increase to be implemented.\n    *   **No Interest:** Landlords can no longer include interest on the loan they took out for the improvement in the MCI calculation.\n    *   **Increased Scrutiny:** DHCR now has stricter criteria for approving MCIs. They will scrutinize whether the improvement was truly necessary, whether the building has a history of code violations, and whether the landlord has adequately maintained the building. If the landlord has a poor maintenance record, the MCI application may be denied or reduced.\n    *   **No \"First MCI\" Exemption:** Previously, the first MCI could be applied without the 2% cap. This is no longer the case; all MCIs are subject to the 2% cap.\n\n4.  **What Doesn't Qualify:**\n    *   Routine repairs (e.g., fixing a leaky faucet, patching a wall, painting an apartment) are considered part of the landlord's regular maintenance obligations and cannot be passed on as an MCI.\n    *   Improvements to individual apartments (Individual Apartment Improvements or IAIs) are a separate category with different rules and are not building-wide.\n\n**What You Should Do if You Receive an MCI Notice:**\n\n1.  **Review the Notice Carefully:** Ensure it's from the DHCR and details the proposed work and cost.\n2.  **Object to DHCR:** If you believe the work doesn't qualify as an MCI, was poorly done, or was simply a repair, you have the right to submit an objection to the DHCR. Gather evidence like photos, repair requests, or witness statements.\n3.  **Check for Violations:** Research if your building has any outstanding housing code violations. A history of violations can be grounds for DHCR to deny or reduce an MCI.\n4.  **Seek Legal Advice:** Consider contacting a tenant attorney or a tenant advocacy group. They can help you understand your rights and navigate the DHCR process.\n\nIn summary, while your landlord can apply for a rent increase due to building-wide capital improvements, the process is highly regulated, subject to tenant objections, and the resulting increase is now temporary and capped.",

When it comes to building-wide work, such as replacing a boiler or installing new equipment, your landlord may be able to raise your rent, but only under certain conditions.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n1. **Major Capital Improvements (MCIs):** If the work is considered an MCI, which is a significant improvement that benefits all tenants in the building, your landlord can raise your rent by up to 6% over the initial stabilized rent for each year of the MCI.\n2. **Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) approval:** To increase your rent due to MCIs, your landlord must apply to the RGB and obtain approval. The RGB sets rent guidelines for rent-stabilized apartments in NYC. If approved, the increased rent will be reflected on your lease agreement.\n3. **Notification requirements:** Your landlord must notify you in writing about the planned MCI, including a description of the work, the estimated cost, and the impact on your rent (if applicable). This notification should occur at least 30 days before starting the project.\n\nTo ensure your rights are protected:\n\n* Review your lease agreement to understand any specific provisions regarding MCIs or rent increases.\n* Keep track of any notifications from your landlord regarding planned work in the building.\n* If you're unsure about a proposed MCI or potential rent increase, consult with an attorney specializing in NYC real estate law.\n\nRemember that not all building-wide work qualifies as an MCI.

            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer\n- For rent\u2011stabilized apartments in buildings with more than 35 units, the permanent IAI rent increase is the qualifying cost of the improvement (less any tenant contribution or outside grants/subsidies) divided by 40. That quotient is the monthly permanent increase added to the legal regulated rent.\n\nWhat you should know (brief)\n- \u201cQualifying cost\u201d = the landlord\u2019s actual cost for capital improvements that qualify as an Individual Apartment Improvement under the Rent Stabilization rules, minus any amounts paid by the tenant or by government/subsidy programs. Non\u2011qualifying repairs, routine maintenance, or appliances may be excluded.\n- For buildings with 35 or fewer units the divisor is 30 (i.e., cost \u00f7 30 = monthly increase).\n- The landlord must give proper notice and register the increase with DHCR (or follow the applicable Rent Guidelines Board/DHCR procedures); tenants may challenge the IAI if the work or the cost is not qualifying or was improperly calculated.\n- Example: net qualifying cost $4,000 in a building >35 units \u2192 $4,000 \u00f7 40 = $100/month permanent increase.\n\nIf you want, tell me the improvement cost, any tenant payments or grants, and whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized, and I\u2019ll calculate the exact monthly increase and outline the notice/appeal steps.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer\n- In NYC rent-stabilized housing, an Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI) is recovered by a permanent rent increase for that specific apartment. The increase is calculated by amortizing the approved cost of the improvement over 15 years (180 months). The monthly amount is added to the apartment\u2019s base rent for all future renewals.\n\nHow the math works (typical case)\n- If the DHCR approves an IAI cost of, say, $18,000 for your apartment:\n  - Amortization period: 15 years = 180 months\n  - Monthly IAI increase: $18,000 \u00f7 180 = $100 per month\n  - This $100 is added to your contract rent (base rent) for every renewal term going forward, until the 15-year amortization has run its course.\n- If your landlord had multiple IAIs approved for the same unit, you would add the monthly amounts from each approved IAI. For example, two IAIs approved at $18,000 each would be $200 per month total ($100 + $100).\n\nNotes\n- The calculation is based on the DHCR-approved IAI cost and amortization period. The 15-year amortization is standard unless a different period was approved in the DHCR order.\n- IAIs are unit-specific. They affect only the unit for which the improvement was approved, not the whole building (unlike MCIs, see below).\n- The IAI rent increase becomes part of the tenant\u2019s base rent and survives lease renewals unless and until the amortization period ends or the order is modified.\n\nAbout your building being more than 35 units\n- The 35-unit threshold mainly affects some other rent-stabilization programs and approvals, but it does not change the basic IAI calculation method (cost \u00f7 180 months) or the fact that the increase is permanent for that unit under the DHCR order. The key factor is that the IAI must be DHCR-approved and an IAI order must exist for your unit.\n\nWhat to check now\n- Look for the DHCR IAI order for your apartment. It should state:\n  - The approved cost of the improvement\n  - The amortization period (usually 180 months)\n  - The monthly IAI increase amount\n  - The date the increase starts\n- Check your rent ledger or annual rent history to confirm the listed IAI amount and its start date.\n- If you think the calculation is incorrect or the IAI was not properly approved, you can file a complaint with the DHCR or seek advice from a housing attorney or tenants\u2019 rights group.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- the approved IAI cost and start date on the DHCR order for your apartment (or upload the rent history showing the IAI line),\n- and whether there are multiple IAIs on your unit.\n\nI can help you compute the exact monthly increase and explain what should appear on your rent records.",
            "Llama 4 Scout": "According to NYC's Rent Stabilization Law, for buildings with more than 35 apartments, when a landlord performs an Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI), the permanent rent increase is calculated as follows:\n\nThe rent increase is limited to the actual cost of the improvement, and there's a specific formula to calculate the increase.\n\nAs of 2022, the IAI rent increase is calculated by dividing the total cost of the improvement by the number of years of useful life of the improvement, as determined by the Rent Stabilization Association (RSA). \n\nThe allowable rent increase is then limited to a maximum of 6% of the initial rent for each year of the useful life of the improvement.\n\nFor example, if the IAI cost $10,000 and has a useful life of 5 years, and the initial rent is $1,500, the annual rent increase would be: \n\n$10,000 / 5 years = $2,000 per year \n6% of $1,500 = $90 per month or $1,080 per year \n\nThe allowable rent increase would be $1,080 per year.\n\nKeep in mind that there may be additional requirements and restrictions, and it's always best to review the specific situation with the relevant authorities or a qualified housing professional. \n\nAlso, note that rent-stabilized tenants have the right to a hearing with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) to dispute the rent increase. \n\nDo you have any further questions or would you like more information on this topic?",

Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Actual Cost**: The landlord can increase the rent based on the actual cost of the improvement, including materials, labor, and other related expenses.\n\n2. **Limit on Increase**: The rent increase is limited to 1/40th of the actual cost of the improvement per year, for a period of 8 years. This means that over the course of 8 years, the landlord can recoup up to 2/5ths (or 40%) of the improvement cost through rent increases.\n\n3. **Maximum Increase per Year**: The annual rent increase cannot exceed $83.33 per month (as of 2023) for each apartment that receives the improvement. This amount is subject to change based on the Rent Guidelines Board's annual adjustments.\n\n4. **Documentation**: The landlord must provide tenants with a detailed statement of the cost of the improvement and the method used to calculate the rent increase.\n\n5. **Approval**: The landlord must file the IAI application with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) and obtain approval before implementing the rent increase.\n\nHere's a simple example: If a landlord spends $10,000 on an IAI, the annual rent increase would be $10,000 / 40 = $250 per year. Over 8 years, the landlord could increase the rent by a total of $2,000 ($250 x 8) to recoup the cost of the improvement.\n\nAlways consult with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal or a legal professional for advice tailored to your specific situation, as housing laws can be complex and subject to change.",
            "gemini-2.5-flash": "You're asking about a key area of NYC rent stabilization law that was significantly changed by the **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) of 2019**.\n\nFor buildings with **more than 35 apartments** (which are generally rent-stabilized), here's how the permanent rent increase for an Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI) is calculated under current NYC law:\n\n1.  **The Calculation Formula:**\n    The landlord can add a permanent rent increase equal to **1/168th** of the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost of the IAI.\n\n    *   **Example:** If an IAI cost $8,400, the monthly rent increase would be $8,400 / 168 = $50 per month.\n\n2.  **The Cost Cap:**\n    There is a **total cost cap** for IAIs that can be passed on to the tenant. The total cost of IAIs for a single apartment over a 15-year period cannot exceed **$15,000**.\n\n3.  **The Monthly Increase Cap:**\n    Because of the $15,000 total cost cap and the 1/168th amortization rate, the **maximum monthly rent increase** for an IAI in a building with more than 35 units is approximately **$89.28** ($15,000 / 168). This is typically rounded down to **$89 per month**.\n\n    *   **Important Note:** This means even if a landlord spends more than $15,000 on IAIs in an apartment, they can only pass on the increase based on a maximum of $15,000 of those costs.\n\n**Key Conditions and Requirements for IAIs:**\n\nFor an IAI rent increase to be legal, the landlord must meet several strict conditions:\n\n*   **Actual, Reasonable, and Verifiable Cost:** The increase must be based on the actual cost of the improvements, and these costs must be reasonable.\n*   **Documentation:** The landlord must maintain detailed records, including invoices, receipts, and proof of payment for all materials and labor. These records must be available for inspection by the tenant or the DHCR (Division of Housing and Community Renewal).\n*   **New Equipment/Improvements:** The IAI must be a genuine improvement that adds to the value of the apartment or prolongs its useful life. It cannot be for routine repairs, maintenance, or replacement of items that have simply worn out due to normal use. The improvement must have a useful life of at least 5 years.\n*   **No Overlap with MCIs:** The cost of the IAI cannot be included in a Major Capital Improvement (MCI) application for the building.\n*   **Tenant Consent (if occupied):** If the apartment was occupied by a tenant at the time the IAI was performed, the tenant must have provided written consent to both the improvements and the rent increase. This consent must be on a DHCR form or a form substantially similar to it. Without this consent, the landlord cannot charge an IAI increase to an occupied apartment.\n*   **No Harassment:** The improvements must not have been made to harass the tenant.\n\n**What this means for you:**\n\nIf your landlord is claiming an IAI increase, you have the right to:\n\n*   **Request Documentation:** Ask for copies of all invoices, receipts, and proof of payment for the claimed improvements.\n*   **Verify the Work:** Ensure the work described matches what was actually done and that it constitutes a genuine improvement, not just a repair.\n*   **Check for Consent:** If you were living in the apartment when the work was done, ensure you provided written consent on the proper form.\n*   **Review Rent History:** The IAI increase becomes part of the legal regulated rent. You can request your apartment's rent history from the DHCR to see how it has been applied.\n\nIf you suspect the IAI increase is not legitimate or is incorrectly calculated, you can file a complaint with the DHCR or consult with a tenant attorney.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am a housing law assistant and this information is for educational purposes only and not legal advice.

            "llama3": "A crucial question!\n\nWhen a landlord conducts an Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI), also known as a \"rental alteration\" or \"capital improvement,\" it's a one-time charge to update or improve a specific apartment. The calculation of the permanent rent increase, also known as a \"capital improvements surcharge\" or \"alteration surcharge,\" is governed by New York City Rent Regulation Law (RRL) \u00a7248. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Cost of Improvement**: The landlord must provide you with a written estimate of the costs involved in making the improvement(s). This includes materials, labor, and any other relevant expenses.\n2. **Apportionment**: The landlord will apportion the total cost of the improvement among all affected apartments. In your case, since there are more than 35 apartments, the landlord must follow the rules for large buildings (RRL \u00a7248(b)).\n3. **Permanent Rent Increase Calculation**: The landlord will calculate the permanent rent increase by dividing the total cost of the improvement by the number of months you've occupied the apartment. This is called the \"per diem\" rate.\n\nLet's use an example to illustrate this:\n\nSuppose the landlord estimates the cost of improving your apartment at $10,000. If you've occupied the apartment for 12 months, the per diem rate would be:\n\n$10,000 (total cost) \u00f7 12 (months) = $833.33 per month\n\nThe landlord will then add this per diem rate to your monthly rent as a permanent surcharge.\n\n**Important**: The permanent rent increase is not subject to rent regulation guidelines and can be increased or decreased only with your written consent, unless the improvement becomes obsolete or unnecessary.\n\nRemember to carefully review any documents provided by the landlord and seek legal advice if you have questions or concerns about the IAI or the calculated rent increase."
