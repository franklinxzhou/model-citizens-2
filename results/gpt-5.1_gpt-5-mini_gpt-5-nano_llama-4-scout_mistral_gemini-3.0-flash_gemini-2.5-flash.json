        "ground_truth": "Yes. The text says the contract between a tenant and landlord can be based on a written lease or a handshake, and that in New York State there are several different laws governing this relationship, which can differ depending on the county or town you live in.",

            "gpt-5.1": "Yes. In New York, a lot of landlord\u2013tenant law applies *even if* you only had a verbal/handshake agreement and no written lease.\n\nKey points under New York State law (and, within NYC, overlapping city rules):\n\n1. **Verbal tenancies are valid**\n   - A month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy can be created by words or conduct (you pay, they accept, you move in), even without a written lease.\n   - Written leases are required mainly for:\n     - Rent\u2011stabilized units\n     - Certain longer/fixed-term arrangements (e.g., a lease for more than 1 year must be in writing under the Statute of Frauds).\n   - But even without that, once you\u2019re in possession and paying rent, you\u2019re typically a lawful tenant, not a \u201cguest.\u201d\n\n2. **State laws that still apply to a handshake deal**\n   Even if your agreement is unwritten, the landlord is still bound by New York statutes, including:\n\n   - **Warranty of Habitability (Real Property Law \u00a7235\u2011b)**  \n     The landlord must keep the apartment safe and habitable (heat, hot water, no conditions dangerous to life/health/safety, etc.). You cannot waive this, even by written lease, so you certainly cannot waive it in a handshake.\n\n   - **Anti\u2011retaliation protection (Real Property Law \u00a7223\u2011b)**  \n     The landlord cannot legally evict or punish you because you complained to 311, HPD, the landlord, or a court about conditions, or you joined a tenant association.\n\n   - **Security deposit rules (General Obligations Law \u00a77\u2011107, \u00a77\u2011108)**  \n     - Deposit must be held in trust for the tenant.\n     - For most rentals, it can\u2019t exceed one month\u2019s rent.\n     - It can only be used for unpaid rent or damage beyond normal wear and tear.\n     - Landlord must give an itemized list of deductions within 14 days of move\u2011out or risk having to return the full deposit.\n     These rules apply whether or not there\u2019s a written lease.\n\n   - **Notice requirements to end a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy (Real Property Law \u00a7226\u2011c)**  \n     State law sets minimum written notice periods based on how long you\u2019ve lived there, even with a handshake deal:\n     - Less than 1 year in unit and no written lease beyond 1 year: 30 days\u2019 notice\n     - 1\u20132 years in unit *or* if you have a lease of 1\u20132 years: 60 days\u2019 notice\n     - 2+ years in unit *or* if you have a lease of 2+ years: 90 days\u2019 notice\n\n   - **Eviction protections (Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law \u2013 RPAPL)**  \n     You can\u2019t be legally evicted without a court case and a court\u2011ordered eviction by a marshal or sheriff. This applies regardless of whether your agreement was written or verbal.\n\n3. **NYC\u2011specific protections that also apply**\n   In New York City specifically, additional rules apply no matter what your lease looks like:\n\n   - **Illegal lockouts / \u201cself\u2011help\u201d eviction are prohibited**  \n     Changing locks, removing doors, shutting off utilities, or otherwise forcing you out without a court order is illegal. You can go to Housing Court for an \u201cillegal lockout\u201d proceeding\u2014even with just a handshake deal.\n\n   - **Housing Maintenance Code**  \n     Local code (enforced by HPD) requires landlords to provide heat, hot water, maintain plumbing, exterminate pests, and keep the place safe. You can call 311 or sue in Housing Court (an HP action) even with no written lease.\n\n4. **Rent stabilization/controlled units**\n   If your NYC apartment is rent\u2011stabilized, then:\n   - The landlord is supposed to offer you a written lease on a prescribed form.\n   - Stabilization rules (rent limits, renewal rights, required services) still apply; those come from law and regulations, not your handshake.\n   - The fact they *didn\u2019t* give you a lease can itself be an issue in your favor, not theirs.\n\n5. **What the handshake mainly affects**\n   - **Proof of terms**: With no written lease, it\u2019s harder to prove agreed rent, included utilities, duration, or other terms if there\u2019s a dispute.\n   - **Term of tenancy**: By default, the law typically treats it as month\u2011to\u2011month unless it\u2019s clearly something else (and longer than a year would normally need to be in writing).\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether you\u2019re in NYC or elsewhere in New York State,\n- How long you\u2019ve lived there,\n- Whether you know if the unit is rent\u2011stabilized,\n\nI can explain exactly which rules apply to your situation and what rights you have right now.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Yes \u2014 New York law still governs your rights and duties even if you only had a \u201chandshake\u201d deal.\n\nKey points\n\n- Oral leases are generally valid. An oral agreement for a residential tenancy that is for one year or less is enforceable. Only leases that run longer than one year must be in writing (the Statute of Frauds).\n- Type of tenancy. If you pay rent periodically (for example, month to month) and have no written fixed-term lease, the law treats you as a month-to-month tenant or a tenancy at will \u2014 you still have legal rights and obligations.\n- Landlord obligations apply. The landlord\u2019s duties (for example, to keep the apartment livable under the implied warranty of habitability and to follow housing and building codes) apply regardless of whether the lease is written.\n- Tenant protections still apply. Tenant protections \u2014 including rent-regulation rules if the unit is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled, protection against illegal lockouts or utility shutoffs, and the requirement that an owner use the courts to evict \u2014 do not disappear because the lease was oral.\n- Evidence matters. An oral agreement can be proved with rent receipts, cancelled checks, bank transfers, texts or emails, witnesses, or other actions that show the parties\u2019 agreement and the rent paid.\n- Security deposits and other rules. Many rules about security deposits, required notices, and rent receipts still apply even with an oral tenancy (and local NYC rules may add protections). Landlords cannot simply take self-help measures like changing the locks.\n\nWhat you can do now\n\n- Keep and assemble proof of the agreement: payments, messages, witnesses, keys, utilities in your name, etc.\n- Pay rent by traceable means (check, bank transfer) and get receipts.\n- Ask the landlord for a written lease.\n- If the landlord fails to make essential repairs, harasses you, or tries to evict you without court proceedings, contact NYC 311/HPD or a tenant legal services organization (Legal Aid Society, NYC Tenant Hotline, Metropolitan Council on Housing) for advice and representation.\n- If you want, I can help you draft a short written lease or a rent receipt template, or suggest next steps based on more details of your situation.\n\nIf you tell me whether the tenancy is in New York City or elsewhere in NY State, how long you\u2019ve been there, whether you paid rent and how, and what problems (if any) you\u2019re facing, I can give more specific guidance.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: yes. New York State (and New York City) have laws that govern landlord\u2013tenant relationships even if you only had a handshake or oral understanding.\n\nKey points you should know\n- Writing not always required, but it matters: For leases longer than one year, NY law (the Statute of Frauds) requires a written agreement to be enforceable. If your deal was for a year or less (or is month\u2011to\u2011month), it can still be a valid tenancy even without a written lease. The terms can be proven by how you and the landlord behaved (paying rent, living there, etc.).\n- What you actually have in practice: With no lease in writing, you\u2019re likely in some kind of periodic tenancy (monthly or week\u2011to\u2011week) or a tenancy at will. Either way, you still have rights and the landlord has obligations, and either side can end the tenancy with proper notice.\n- Habitability is a baseline: Landlords must keep the unit reasonably clean, safe, livable, and have essential services (heat, hot water, etc.). This applies regardless of whether there\u2019s a written lease.\n- Landlord\u2011tenant protections exist beyond a contract: You have rights to privacy, reasonable notice before entry, protection against harassment, repair obligations, and due process if the landlord tries to evict you.\n- Rent stabilization and other local rules: If your building or unit is subject to rent stabilization or other NYC/State housing regulations, there are additional protections (renewal rights, regulated rent increases, etc.). Many buildings aren\u2019t stabilized, but some are. Checking your building\u2019s status is important.\n\nWhat to do if you\u2019re in a handshake deal\n- Confirm your tenancy type: Are you on a month\u2011to\u2011month plan, week\u2011to\u2011week, or something else? Note when you started paying rent and living there.\n- Check for rent\u2011stabilized status (if in NYC): Some buildings are regulated. Use the NYC/DHCR tools or ask a local housing attorney or a legal aid clinic to help verify.\n- Document everything: Keep copies of payments, receipts, notices, communications with the landlord, photos of condition, and any repair requests.\n- If problems arise:\n  - For repairs or habitability issues: contact 311 (NYC) and/or HPD, and document the problem and any city orders or inspections.\n  - For potential eviction or harassment: know that evictions must go through a court process; you have rights during that process.\n  - For disputes about deposits or terms: gather evidence (receipts, correspondences) and seek legal help.\n\nWhere to get targeted help\n- NYC-specific resources: NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the NYC Rent Guidelines Board (for rent\u2011stabilized issues). 311 can route you to the right agency.\n- State resources: New York State DHCR (Division of Housing and Community Renewal) for rent stabilization, registration, and related topics; NYS legal aid clinics or a private attorney with housing\u2011law experience.\n- If you want, tell me your borough/area, whether you think the unit is rent\u2011stabilized, and what problem you\u2019re facing (e.g., repairs, eviction threat, heat/hot water issue). I can tailor the steps and point you to the right agency or resources.\n\nBottom line: handshake deals don\u2019t mean you\u2019re outside the law. NY law provides protections and regulates the landlord\u2013tenant relationship even without a written contract, and there are specific rules that may apply if your building is subject to rent stabilization or other local housing laws. If you want, share a bit more detail and I\u2019ll help map out the exact rights and next steps for your situation.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, absolutely! You are right to be confused, as it can be a complex area, but here's a clear breakdown for NYC:\n\n1.  **New York State Laws Govern Landlord-Tenant Relationships:**\n    New York State has a comprehensive set of laws (primarily in the Real Property Law and the General Obligations Law) that govern the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants. These laws apply statewide, regardless of whether you have a written lease or just a handshake deal.\n\n2.  **New York City Has *Additional* and Often *Stronger* Protections:**\n    On top of the state laws, New York City has its own set of laws (like the NYC Administrative Code and the Housing Maintenance Code) that provide even more protections for tenants. These NYC-specific laws are crucial for anyone renting in the five boroughs.\n\n3.  **The \"Handshake Deal\" (Oral Agreement) is Generally Valid, With a Key Exception:**\n\n    *   **For Leases Less Than One Year:** An oral agreement (a handshake deal) for a lease term of **less than one year** is generally legally binding and enforceable in New York. The terms you agreed upon (rent amount, due date, who pays utilities, etc.) are legally valid, even if not written down.\n    *   **For Leases One Year or More (Statute of Frauds):** There's a critical legal principle called the \"Statute of Frauds.\" This law generally requires that any agreement that *cannot be performed within one year* (like a lease for a term of one year or longer) **must be in writing** to be legally enforceable. If you had a handshake deal for, say, a two-year lease, it might not be enforceable in court if one party backs out, because it wasn't in writing. However, if you've already moved in and are paying rent, an oral agreement for a term longer than a year can still create a month-to-month tenancy.\n\n**Key Protections That *Always* Apply (Regardless of Lease Type or Whether it's Written):**\n\nEven with just a handshake deal, you are still protected by fundamental tenant rights under NY State and NYC law:\n\n*   **Implied Warranty of Habitability:** Your landlord must provide and maintain a safe, livable, and sanitary apartment. This means they must keep the building in good repair, provide heat, hot water, and essential services, and address issues like pests, leaks, or dangerous conditions. This cannot be waived, even in a written lease.\n*   **Proper Eviction Procedures:** A landlord cannot simply kick you out. They must follow specific legal procedures, which involve giving you proper notice and obtaining a court order through a Housing Court proceeding. \"Self-help\" evictions (like changing locks, turning off utilities, or removing your belongings) are illegal.\n*   **Anti-Discrimination Laws:** Landlords cannot discriminate against you based on protected characteristics (race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, source of income, etc.).\n*   **Anti-Retaliation Laws:** Your landlord cannot retaliate against you (e.g., by trying to evict you or refusing to renew your lease) for asserting your legal rights, such as complaining about conditions or joining a tenant association.\n*   **Security Deposit Rules:** There are limits on how much a landlord can charge for a security deposit (one month's rent in NYC) and strict rules about how it must be held and returned.\n*   **Rent Stabilization/Control:** This is a huge one for NYC. If your building is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled, those protections apply to you *even if you only have an oral agreement* and even if your landlord tries to claim otherwise. The status of the building determines this, not your lease.\n\n**Important Considerations for Handshake Deals:**\n\nWhile legally valid for terms under a year, oral agreements are inherently more difficult to prove. If a dispute arises, it becomes your word against your landlord's. This is why it's always strongly recommended to get everything in writing.\n\n**In summary:** Yes, New York State and New York City have extensive laws governing landlord-tenant relationships, and many of these protections apply even if you only had a handshake deal. However, for your own protection, always try to get a written lease and keep detailed records of all communications and payments.\n\nIf you have specific concerns about your situation, it's always best to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant advocacy organization.",
            "llama3": "Don't worry about being confused - it's understandable! In New York State, yes, there are laws that govern the landlord-tenant relationship, regardless of whether you have a written lease or just a verbal agreement (like a \"handshake deal\").\n\nNew York State has enacted several laws to protect tenants and ensure fairness in the landlord-tenant relationship. These laws apply to all residential rental agreements, including verbal agreements, as long as they are for a period longer than one month.\n\nHere are some key points:\n\n1. **New York State General Obligations Law (GOL) Article 7**: This article governs the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in residential rental agreements.\n2. **Real Property Law (RPL)**: This law deals with the relationship between landlords and tenants, including issues like rent, security deposits, and evictions.\n\nSome specific laws you should know about:\n\n* **Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997**: This law regulates rents for many types of residential properties in New York City.\n* **New York State Security Deposit Law** (GOL \u00a7 5-601): This law sets rules for the handling of security deposits, including requirements for their use and any deductions that can be made.\n\nEven if you don't have a written lease, these laws still apply. So, what does this mean?\n\n1. **Rent is still due**: Even without a written lease, you're still obligated to pay rent on time.\n2. **Landlord responsibilities remain**: Landlords are still responsible for maintaining the property and providing essential services like heat and water.\n3. **Tenant rights persist**: As a tenant, you have certain rights under New York State law, such as the right to a safe and habitable living environment.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with your landlord or have concerns about your living situation, it's always best to consult with an attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant law."

            "gpt-5.1": "In New York City, apartments are usually either:\n\n- **Rent\u2011stabilized** (most common form of rent regulation)\n- **Rent\u2011controlled** (rare, older tenancies)\n- **Unregulated / market\u2011rate**\n\nHere\u2019s how to check, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Use the official state tool (best first step)\n\n**NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)** is the state agency that oversees rent regulation.\n\n1. Gather information:\n   - Address and apartment number\n   - Your name\n2. Request the **rent history** for your apartment:\n   - Online: https://rent.hcr.ny.gov/RentConnect/Tenant/Welcome\n   - By phone: HCR Rent Info Line: 718\u2011739\u20116400\n   - In person: HCR borough offices\n\nIf the rent history shows entries like:\n- \u201cRS\u201d (rent stabilized),\n- \u201cRent Stabilized\u201d annotations, or\n- Legal regulated rent registrations for multiple years\n\n\u2026your apartment has been registered as rent\u2011stabilized.\n\nIf HCR says there is **no rent registration**, that does *not* definitively prove it\u2019s unregulated (owners sometimes fail to register). It means you need to look deeper.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Check basic building facts\n\nUse the NYC Department of Housing Preservation & Development (HPD) database:\n\n- HPD Housing Info: https://hpdonline.nyc.gov\n\nLook up your building by address. Useful indicators:\n- **Number of units** (rent stabilization generally applies to buildings with 6 or more units built before 1974, with exceptions)\n- **Building class** and registration history\n\nAlso check:\n- NYC Dept. of Finance (ACRIS / Property tax info): how many units are legally on record.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Compare with typical rent\u2011stabilized criteria\n\nRent stabilization usually applies if:\n\n1. **Building size and age**\n   - 6 or more residential units, and\n   - Built before Jan 1, 1974  \n   (there are also some newer buildings with tax benefits that require stabilization \u2013 see below)\n\n2. **Apartment not lawfully deregulated**\n   - High\u2011rent deregulation was eliminated in 2019, but past deregulations may still matter historically.\n   - Many apartments were improperly deregulated, so being \u201cmarket rate\u201d in the lease doesn\u2019t automatically make it legal.\n\n3. **The rent history suggests prior regulation**\n   - Sudden big jumps or a year where the record stops can be a red flag.\n\nIf your building fits this profile, it\u2019s worth assuming it *might* be regulated until you confirm otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Check for tax benefits that require rent stabilization\n\nSome newer or renovated buildings must provide rent\u2011stabilized apartments in exchange for tax breaks (like 421\u2011a, J\u201151, etc.).\n\nTo check:\n- NYC Dept. of Finance Property Tax Benefits Search:\n  https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-benefits.page\n\nIf your building received certain benefits during your tenancy, many or all units may have to be rent\u2011stabilized, even if built after 1974.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Look for clues in your lease and paperwork\n\nYour lease may provide hints (but is not conclusive):\n\nSigns it *might* be rent\u2011stabilized:\n- A rider titled **\u201cRent Stabilization Rider\u201d** or references to:\n  - \u201cRent Stabilization Code\u201d\n  - \u201cRSC\u201d\n  - \u201cDHCR\u201d\n- A \u201cpreferential rent\u201d clause stating a **legal regulated rent** and a lower \u201cpreferential\u201d rent\n- Renewal leases offered on **DHCR Form RTP\u20118**\n\nSigns it\u2019s *likely* unregulated:\n- Purely landlord\u2019s own lease, no DHCR forms or rider, and\n- Building is small (1\u20135 units) or clearly not covered by a tax program requiring stabilization\n\nRemember: a lease saying \u201cunregulated\u201d or \u201cfree market\u201d doesn\u2019t control if the law says the unit should be regulated.\n\n---\n\n## 6. If HCR has no record but you suspect regulation\n\nCommon situations:\n- Building has 6+ units, built before 1974\n- Rents or registrations suddenly disappear from the HCR history\n- Very large rent increases between tenants\n\nWhat you can do:\n1. **Save everything**: current lease, prior leases, emails, rent receipts, advertisements.\n2. Consider speaking with:\n   - A tenant attorney; or\n   - A tenant clinic or nonprofit (e.g., Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC, TakeRoot Justice, local tenant organizations).\n3. You can file an **Overcharge/Status complaint** with HCR if you believe the owner illegally deregulated or overcharged.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Rent\u2011controlled vs. rent\u2011stabilized\n\n**Rent\u2011controlled**:\n- Usually in buildings built before 1947\n- Tenant (or succession family member) has often lived there continuously since before July 1, 1971\n- Very rare; if you moved in recently, you are almost certainly *not* rent\u2011controlled\n\nMost regulated tenants today are **rent\u2011stabilized**, not rent\u2011controlled.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Quick checklist\n\nYou\u2019re **likely rent\u2011stabilized** if:\n- Building has **6+ units**\n- Built **before 1974** (or has 421\u2011a/J\u201151 or similar benefits during your tenancy)\n- HCR rent history shows registrations and/or \u201cRS\u201d\n- You get renewal leases on DHCR forms or with a Rent Stabilization Rider\n\nYou\u2019re **likely unregulated** if:\n- 1\u20132 family home (and not subject to special programs)\n- Condo/co\u2011op where unit was never rent\u2011stabilized and no tax program requires it\n- Small building (under 6 units), built after 1974, no tax benefits\n- HCR rent history has no record, and building facts fit unregulated status\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Your building\u2019s approximate year of construction  \n- Number of units  \n- What your HCR rent history shows (if anything)  \n- Any tax abatement info you find  \n\nI can walk through your specific situation and give a more concrete assessment of whether your apartment is likely rent\u2011regulated under NYC law.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: the only sure way is to get the apartment\u2019s official rent history/registration from New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). There are clues you can check yourself first and steps you can take to confirm.\n\nWhat to look for (quick clues)\n- Read your lease. Rent\u2011stabilized leases usually include a Rent Stabilization Rider and language about renewal rights/renewal offers. Rent\u2011controlled units say \u201crent control\u201d and show very low historical rents.\n- Building age and size. In NYC, most rent\u2011stabilized buildings are 6+ units and were first occupied before June 30, 1974. (That is only a rough rule \u2014 there are many exceptions.)\n- Tax/subsidy benefits. Buildings with certain tax abatements or subsidies (J\u201151, some 421\u2011a/421\u2011g programs, federal Section 8, other government programs) are often rent\u2011regulated even if built later.\n- Landlord behavior. If you get a standard \u201cmarket\u201d lease with no renewal form and no rent\u2011stabilization rider, and the landlord does not register rents annually, the unit may be unregulated \u2014 but you need confirmation.\n- Rent amount and history. Very low historic rents that change only with DHCR increases are a sign of rent control/stabilization.\n\nHow to confirm (definitive)\n1. Request an official rent history/registration from NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). HCR\u2019s rent history/registration record is the authoritative proof of whether the apartment is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled. You can request this on HCR\u2019s website or by contacting them. Their website: https://hcr.ny.gov\n2. Ask your landlord in writing for the apartment\u2019s rent history, the rent registration number, and any rent stabilization/controlled rider. Landlords of regulated units are required to provide certain information and to file registrations.\n3. If you still aren\u2019t sure, file a complaint or request assistance through HCR (or call 311 for NYC tenant help/referrals) and/or contact HPD (NYC Department of Housing Preservation & Development) for building records: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/index.page\n\nOther practical tips\n- Rent control is rare today; it applies to a small number of units in buildings originally built before 1947 and continuously occupied by the same tenant/household since the applicable cutoff dates.\n- Do not rely only on building age/size \u2014 tax benefits, subsidy programs, conversions, and other legal events can create or preserve regulation.\n- If your landlord refuses to provide requested information or you suspect misclassification, get the rent history from HCR and consider contacting a tenant attorney or a tenant organization (Legal Aid, Legal Services, or a tenant union) for help.\n\nIf you want, tell me the building borough, street address, and apartment number and I\u2019ll point you to the most direct public records search and explain what to request from HCR.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer\n- Most NYC apartments that are \u201crent regulated\u201d are rent-stabilized (the vast majority today).\n- \u201cRent regulated\u201d also used to include rent control, but rent-controlled units are very rare in NYC today (they are in a few very old pre-1947 buildings and are becoming fewer as tenants move or leave).\n\nHow to find out for your specific apartment\n- Check your lease first\n  - If the lease or rider says it is a Rent Stabilized lease or shows a \u201clegal rent\u201d and a Rent Stabilization Rider, your unit is rent-stabilized.\n  - Some leases show a \u201cpreferential rent\u201d (the rent you pay is lower than the legal stabilized rent). The presence of a preferential rent doesn\u2019t mean the unit isn\u2019t stabilized; it can still be rent-stabilized.\n- Look up the unit with official sources\n  - New York State DHCR (Division of Housing and Community Renewal): Use the Rent Stabilization Look-Up tool to see if a specific apartment is registered as rent-stabilized and what the legal rent is. You can search by building address (and sometimes by apartment number).\n  - NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD): HPD offers a Rent-Stabilized Apartment Look-Up for NYC addresses. This can tell you if the building has rent-stabilized units.\n  - If you have trouble with online tools, you can contact DHCR or HPD for help or ask your landlord for the most recent Rent Stabilization Registration (RS certificate) or the current legal rent.\n- Ask the landlord for documents\n  - Landlords of rent-stabilized buildings are supposed to have registrations with DHCR and can provide: your unit\u2019s current legal rent, the current stabilized rent, and the RS certificate or rent registration details. You can request these in writing.\n- What to watch for\n  - If the building is older (pre-1974) and has 6+ units, it\u2019s commonly rent-stabilized, but there are exemptions (buildings that converted to condos/coops, certain tax-exemption buildings, new construction, etc.).\n  - Rent control is now extremely rare in NYC and generally limited to a few pre-1947 units; you\u2019d still verify via the same official look-ups.\n  - A unit can be stabilized even if the advertised rent seems high if the landlord initially offered a lower (preferential) rent; the legal stabilized rent is the one the landlord must adhere to on renewal.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your building address (and apartment number, if you have it) and I can help you walk through which official look-up to use and interpret the results.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Determining whether your New York City apartment is rent-regulated (either Rent Controlled or Rent Stabilized) or unregulated (market rate) can be complex, but there are several key ways to find out.\n\nHere's how you can investigate your apartment's status:\n\n### 1. The Most Reliable Method: Contact NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)\n\nHCR is the state agency responsible for administering rent regulation. They maintain records of all rent-regulated apartments.\n\n*   **Request a Rent History:** This is the most definitive way. You can request a \"rent history\" for your apartment. This document will show:\n    *   Whether the apartment is registered as rent-stabilized.\n    *   The registered rent for previous years.\n    *   The names of previous tenants (sometimes redacted).\n    *   Any preferential rent agreements.\n    *   **How to request:**\n        *   **Online:** Visit the HCR website (hcr.ny.gov) and look for their \"Rent Info Line\" or \"Rent History Request\" section.\n        *   **Phone:** Call the HCR Rent Info Line at **718-739-6400**.\n        *   **Mail:** You can also submit a written request.\n    *   **What you'll need:** Your building address, apartment number, and ideally, the name of the current or previous tenant.\n\n### 2. Check Your Lease and Lease Riders\n\nYour lease documents can provide strong clues:\n\n*   **Rent Stabilized Lease Rider:** If your apartment is rent-stabilized, your landlord is legally required to provide you with a \"Rent Stabilized Lease Rider\" at the time of lease signing and renewal. This rider outlines your rights and the rules of rent stabilization.\n*   **Preferential Rent Clause:** If your lease states you are paying a \"preferential rent\" (a rent lower than the legal regulated rent), this is a strong indicator that your apartment is rent-stabilized.\n*   **J-51 or 421-a Tax Abatement Language:** Some buildings receive tax abatements (like J-51 or 421-a). If your building receives these, the apartments within it are often subject to rent stabilization for the duration of the abatement. Your lease might mention these.\n\n### 3. Consider Your Building's Characteristics\n\nCertain building characteristics make an apartment more likely to be rent-regulated:\n\n*   **Age of Building:**\n    *   **Built before 1947:** These buildings are the only ones that can contain **Rent Controlled** apartments. However, Rent Control is very rare and applies only to tenants who have lived in the same apartment continuously since July 1, 1971.\n    *   **Built before January 1, 1974, with 6 or more units:** These buildings are generally subject to **Rent Stabilization**.\n    *   **Built after 1974:** Even newer buildings can be rent-stabilized if they received certain tax abatements (like J-51 or 421-a) or if they were substantially rehabilitated with government assistance.\n*   **Number of Units:** Buildings with **6 or more units** are generally more likely to be rent-stabilized. Buildings with fewer than 6 units are typically exempt unless they received specific tax abatements.\n\n### 4. Ask Your Landlord (with caution)\n\nYou can ask your landlord or building management directly. However, be aware that:\n\n*   They might not know the correct status.\n*   They might intentionally misinform you.\n*   Their answer is not legally binding; HCR's records are.\n\n### 5. Talk to Your Neighbors\n\nNeighbors, especially long-term residents, might know the building's history and whether other units are rent-regulated. While not definitive for your specific unit, it can provide context.\n\n### 6. Check Online Resources\n\nSome non-profit organizations and websites offer tools that can provide clues, though they are not official determinations:\n\n*   **JustFix.nyc:** Has a tool to help tenants check their building's status.\n*   **WhoOwnsWhat.nyc:** Can provide information about your building's ownership and sometimes tax abatements.\n*   **NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) website:** You can search for your building's address to see its age, permits, and sometimes information related to tax abatements.\n\n### What if it's Unregulated (Market Rate)?\n\nIf your apartment is not rent-regulated, it's considered \"market rate.\" This means:\n\n*   Your landlord can set the rent at whatever they choose.\n*   There are no limits on rent increases (beyond what's agreed upon in your lease).\n*   You have fewer protections against eviction (though landlords still need a legal reason to evict).\n*   You still have basic tenant rights under New York State law, such as the right to a habitable apartment and proper notice for rent increases or lease non-renewals.\n\n### If You're Still Unsure or Suspect Your Apartment Should Be Regulated:\n\nIt's highly recommended to seek assistance from a tenant rights organization or a housing attorney. They can help you interpret HCR records, understand your rights, and potentially challenge an unregulated status if they believe it's incorrect.\n\n*   **Tenant Rights Organizations:**\n    *   Met Council on Housing\n    *   Legal Aid Society\n    *   Legal Services NYC\n    *   Housing Conservation Coordinators\n    *   Your local elected official's office often has housing specialists.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to determine whether your New York City apartment is rent-regulated or unregulated.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, rent regulation status can be a crucial aspect of renting an apartment. Here's how you can determine whether your NYC apartment is rent-regulated or not:\n\n**Rent-Controlled Apartments:**\n\n1. **Check the lease**: Look for a statement indicating that the apartment is subject to rent control.\n2. **Check with the landlord**: Ask your landlord if the apartment is rent-controlled and what the rent regulation laws are.\n3. **Check the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) website**: Visit [hpdcn.nyc.gov](http://hpdcn.nyc.gov) and search for the building's information. If it's listed as a rent-controlled building, your apartment is likely regulated.\n\n**Rent-Stabilized Apartments:**\n\n1. **Check the lease**: Look for a statement indicating that the apartment is subject to rent stabilization.\n2. **Check with the landlord**: Ask your landlord if the apartment is rent-stabilized and what the rent regulation laws are.\n3. **Check the NYC Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) website**: Visit [www.rgbs.nyc.gov](http://www.rgbs.nyc.gov) and search for the building's information. If it's listed as a rent-stabilized building, your apartment is likely regulated.\n\n**Unregulated Apartments:**\n\nIf your apartment doesn't fit either of these categories, it's considered unregulated or market-rate. This means that the landlord can increase the rent without restriction, usually with 30 days' notice.\n\nSome additional factors to consider:\n\n* **Post-War Buildings**: If your building was constructed before World War II (1938), it's likely rent-controlled.\n* **Mitchell-Lama Apartments**: These apartments are part of a special program that allows for rent regulation and affordable housing. You can check if your apartment is Mitchell-Lama regulated on the [NYC HPD website](http://hpdcn.nyc.gov).\n* **J-51 Lease Agreements**: Some apartments have J-51 lease agreements, which allow for limited rent increases. These agreements usually expire after a certain number of years.\n\nRemember to always review your lease carefully and ask questions if you're unsure about your apartment's rent regulation status."

Rent control in NYC is very narrow now.\n\nAsk these questions in order:\n\n1. **Was the apartment continuously occupied by the same tenant (or qualifying family successor) since before July 1, 1971?**  \n   - If **no**, it\u2019s almost certainly **not** rent controlled.  \n   - If **yes**, continue.\n\n2. **Is the building a pre\u20111947 multiple dwelling?**  \n   - Rent control generally covers apartments in **buildings built before February 1, 1947** that have **at least 3 residential units**.  \n   - If the building was built **1950s, 1960s, or later**, it is **not rent controlled** (though it might be rent\u2011stabilized).\n\n3. **Is the apartment still the tenant\u2019s primary residence?**  \n   - Rent control requires the tenant to occupy it as a **primary residence**.  \n   - If the tenant permanently moved out, lost primary residence status, or died without a qualifying family member taking over, rent control protection usually ends.\n\n4. **Is it one of the typical exclusions?**  \n   Common exclusions from rent control include:\n   - Owner\u2011occupied 1\u2011 or 2\u2011family houses\n   - Co\u2011ops/condos where the tenant is the owner-occupant\n   - Certain government\u2011owned or subsidized housing (e.g., NYCHA)\n   - Newly created units (e.g., new basement unit, substantial conversions) after the cutoff dates\n\nIf you want a practical \u201ceasy test\u201d:\n\n- **If the first tenant there moved in after July 1, 1971 \u2192 not rent controlled.**  \n- **If the building was built after 1946 \u2192 not rent controlled.**\n\nTo get more certainty:\n\n1. **Check DOB records for building age and unit count**  \n   - Use NYC Department of Buildings \u201cBuilding Information Search\u201d and look at \u201cYear Built\u201d and \u201c# of Residential Units.\u201d\n\n2. **Ask the tenant about when they (or their predecessor) first moved in**  \n   - A genuine rent\u2011controlled tenancy usually involves someone (or their family) who has been there since the late 1960s or earlier.\n\n3. **Request a rent regulation status letter**  \n   - You can contact **NY Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)** and request a building or apartment rent regulation status inquiry.  \n   - Website: https://hcr.ny.gov  \n   - You can also call the Office of Rent Administration info line.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The building\u2019s year built,\n- The number of apartments, and\n- How long the current tenant (or their predecessor) has lived there,\n\nI can walk you through whether rent control is realistically possible for that unit.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: yes \u2014 there are a few quick checks that usually tell you whether a unit could be rent\u2011controlled. Rent control is now rare, but it still exists for apartments in very old buildings occupied continuously by the same tenant (or a qualifying successor) since before 1971.\n\nWhat to check (simple checklist)\n\n- Year the building was built. Most rent\u2011controlled apartments are in buildings constructed before 1947. You can check \u201cYear Built\u201d on the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) Building Information (Building Information Search).\n- How long the apartment has been continuously occupied. Rent control generally applies only to tenants (or qualifying family members/successors) who have occupied the apartment continuously since before July 1, 1971. Ask the landlord or current/previous tenant for move\u2011in dates or look at old leases, rent receipts, or utility records.\n- Official registration / rent history. New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR, formerly DHCR) keeps rent registration and rent\u2011history records that show whether an apartment is rent\u2011controlled or rent\u2011stabilized. You can request the apartment\u2019s rent history from HCR (online or by mail); the rent history will state the regulation status.\n- What your lease or landlord says. If the landlord\u2019s paperwork or a renewal form identifies the apartment as \u201crent\u2011controlled,\u201d that\u2019s an important clue \u2014 but confirm with HCR records if possible.\n\nWhere to go for a definitive answer\n\n- Check DOB for year built.\n- Request the apartment\u2019s rent history / registration from NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR). The rent history is the most reliable source showing whether the unit is rent\u2011controlled.\n- If you\u2019re still unsure, call HCR or contact a tenant advice/legal organization (Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC, a tenant association, or a housing attorney) for help.\n\nIf you want, give me the building address and unit number (or tell me the year built and when the current/previous tenant moved in), and I can walk you through what to request from HCR or draft a rent\u2011history request letter.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Yes. The easiest and most reliable way is to check the building\u2019s rent-regulation status with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). They maintain up-to-date information on whether a building or unit is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled.\n\nWhat to do:\n- Get your building\u2019s full address.\n- Go to the DHCR Rent Information Portal (RIP) at rentinfo.ny.gov.\n- Enter the address to look up the building. The portal will show whether the building or any units are rent-stabilized or rent-controlled, and it may show base rents and other details.\n\nWhat the results mean:\n- Rent-stabilized (RS): Very common in NYC for buildings built before 1974 (and some later buildings). RS units have regulated rent increases set by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n- Rent-controlled (RC): Much rarer today; typically only exists in a very small number of pre-1947 buildings. If a unit is RC, it\u2019s under a separate, older regime with its own rules.\n- Exempt or not regulated: Some buildings or units are exempt from RS/RC (for example, some owner-occupied 1- or 2-family buildings, certain types of new construction, or units converted to co-ops/condos).\n\nOther quick checks (not as definitive as DHCR):\n- Read your lease: Some leases include a note about \u201crent stabilization\u201d or provide a rider. If you see references to stabilization or an official riders, that\u2019s a clue.\n- Ask the landlord or building manager: They should be able to confirm the unit\u2019s status and provide any required paperwork.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, share the address (or a district) and I can help you navigate the DHCR RIP steps or interpret whatever status you find. Note that exact status can be unit-specific, and some buildings have both RS and exempt units. For definitive guidance, DHCR information is best, and you can also contact a tenants\u2019 rights group or a housing attorney if you need help with a specific lease or eviction/lease issue.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "You're asking a great question that many New Yorkers have! While there isn't always one *single* \"easy\" way to definitively tell, there are several strong indicators and a clear path to finding out for sure.\n\nFirst, it's important to clarify the terms:\n\n*   **Rent Control:** This is very rare in NYC. It applies to tenants who have been in their apartments continuously since July 1, 1971, or whose families have been there since then. These buildings are typically older (built before 1947).\n*   **Rent Stabilization:** This is far more common and is likely what most people mean when they say \"rent control.\" It covers millions of apartments in NYC.\n\nHere are the \"easy ways\" to tell if your building *could be* under **rent stabilization**:\n\n### Strong Indicators (The \"Easy\" Clues)\n\n1.  **Building Age and Size:**\n    *   **Built before January 1, 1974, AND has 6 or more units.** This is the most common and straightforward indicator. If your building fits this description, it is *very likely* rent-stabilized, unless it was legally deregulated (which is harder to do since the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act).\n    *   *Exception:* Even if built *after* 1974, a building can be rent-stabilized if it received certain tax abatements (like J-51 or 421-a).\n\n2.  **Your Lease or Rent Bill:**\n    *   **Rent Stabilization Rider:** If your lease includes a \"Rent Stabilization Rider,\" that's a clear sign. Landlords are legally required to provide this rider to rent-stabilized tenants.\n    *   **DHCR Registration Number:** Sometimes, a rent bill or lease will include a registration number from the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). This is a definitive sign.\n\n3.  **Previous Tenant's Status:**\n    *   If you know a previous tenant in your apartment was rent-stabilized, your apartment likely still is, especially after the 2019 changes.\n\n### Why It's Not Always \"Easy\" (and What to Do Next)\n\n*   **Landlord Non-Compliance:** A landlord might *not* provide a rent stabilization rider, even if the apartment is stabilized. This doesn't mean it's not stabilized; it means the landlord isn't following the rules.\n*   **Tax Abatements:** As mentioned, buildings built after 1974 can be stabilized if they received J-51 or 421-a tax abatements. These abatements can be hard to spot without looking up public records.\n*   **Legal Deregulation (Less Common Now):** Before 2019, apartments could be deregulated if the rent reached a certain threshold and the apartment became vacant. This is much harder to do now, but some apartments were legally deregulated before the law changed.\n\n### The Definitive Way to Find Out\n\nThe most accurate way to determine if your apartment is rent-stabilized is to **request a rent history from the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).**\n\n1.  **How to Request Rent History:**\n    *   You can submit an \"Application for a Rent History\" (form RA-H-1) to DHCR.\n    *   You'll need your building address and apartment number.\n    *   DHCR maintains records of all registered rent-stabilized apartments. If your apartment appears in their records, it is rent-stabilized. If it doesn't, it's likely not, *unless* the landlord failed to register it (which is illegal).\n\n2.  **Check for Tax Abatements:**\n    *   You can search the NYC Department of Finance (DOF) website or ACRIS (Automated City Register Information System) for your building's tax records. Look for mentions of J-51 or 421-a abatements. If present, the building (and likely your apartment) is rent-stabilized for the duration of the abatement.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Easy Clues:** Building built before 1974 with 6+ units, or a Rent Stabilization Rider on your lease.\n*   **Definitive Answer:** Request a rent history from DHCR.\n\nIf you suspect your apartment should be rent-stabilized but your landlord denies it or doesn't provide a rider, it's a good idea to consult with a housing attorney or tenant advocacy group.",
            "llama3": "Rent control laws vary by location, but I'll provide a general outline to help you determine if your building might be under rent control. Keep in mind that the specific rules and regulations depend on where you live.\n\n**What is rent control?**\n\nRent control is a law or ordinance that regulates rental increases for certain properties. The goal is to protect tenants from excessive price hikes and ensure they can continue living in their homes without experiencing sudden, drastic rent increases.\n\n**Key factors to check if your building might be under rent control:**\n\n1. **Location**: Rent control laws often apply to specific cities or regions. If you live in a major metropolitan area like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Washington D.C., it's possible that some buildings are subject to rent control.\n2. **Building age**: Older buildings (typically built before a certain date) may be covered by rent control laws. For example:\n\t* In New York City, buildings constructed before 1947 are generally under rent stabilization.\n\t* In San Francisco, buildings constructed before 1920 are eligible for rent control.\n3. **Building type**: Certain types of properties might be exempt or subject to special rules. For instance:\n\t* Luxury buildings with high-end amenities might not be covered by rent control.\n\t* Buildings owned and operated by government entities (e.g., public housing) may have their own regulations.\n4. **Landlord-tenant relationships**: Rent control laws often apply to specific landlord-tenant situations, such as:\n\t* Rent-controlled buildings where the landlord is required to register with the local authorities.\n\t* Tenancies that are regulated under a specific ordinance or law (e.g., New York City's Rent Stabilization Law).\n5. **Check local regulations**: Research your local government's website or contact your city's housing department to inquire about rent control laws and their applicability to your building.\n\n**How to verify if your building is under rent control:**\n\n1. Review the lease agreement: Check the original lease agreement, any amendments, and renewal agreements for mentions of rent control.\n2. Contact your landlord: Reach out to your landlord or property manager and ask about the building's status regarding rent control.\n3. Check with local authorities: Contact your city's housing department, local government office, or relevant regulatory agency to inquire about rent control laws affecting your building.\n\nRemember that specific regulations may vary depending on where you live, so it's essential to research and verify the information for your location."

Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n**1. New York City (5 boroughs)**  \nRent control still exists for certain apartments in NYC that meet all of these conditions:\n\n- The building was built **before February 1, 1947**, **and**\n- The tenant (or their predecessor, usually a family member) has been living there **continuously since before July 1, 1971**, **and**\n- The unit has never been vacated or otherwise removed from rent control.\n\nWhen a rent\u2011controlled tenant moves out, the apartment usually shifts to **rent stabilization** (if the building has 6+ units and meets other criteria) or becomes deregulated, depending on the circumstances.\n\n**2. Outside NYC: other NYC-metropolitan municipalities with local rent control laws**  \nNew York State law allows certain localities in the **\u201cEmergency Tenant Protection Act\u201d (ETPA) area** to have rent control if they adopted it before the system was effectively closed to new localities. In practice, there are still some rent\u2011controlled units in a few municipalities in **Nassau, Westchester, and Rockland Counties**, for example:\n\n- **Nassau County**: e.g., parts of the Town of Hempstead, Village of Freeport  \n- **Westchester County**: e.g., White Plains, Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Ossining, Tuckahoe  \n- **Rockland County**: e.g., Village of Spring Valley\n\nHowever, the number of **rent-controlled** apartments in these places is very small, and most regulated apartments there are **rent-stabilized**, not rent-controlled.\n\n**3. No new rent control areas can be created**  \nUnder current New York State law, **no new municipalities can adopt classic rent control**.

Only a small number of pre\u20111971 apartments in NYC remain rent\u2011controlled.  \n\nWhat that means\n- Rent control generally covers apartments in buildings originally built before Feb. 1, 1947 that have been continuously occupied by the same tenant (or lawful successor) since before July 1, 1971.  \n- Because of those strict date/continuity rules, the number of rent\u2011controlled units has steadily declined and is now small.\n\nOutside New York City\n- Rent control (the old rent\u2011control system described above) is not generally in effect elsewhere in the state.  \n- Some suburbs and other municipalities are subject to rent regulation under the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (ETPA), which creates rent stabilization-type rules in covered areas \u2014 but that is different from classic \u201crent control.\u201d\n\nHow to find out if a specific apartment is rent\u2011controlled\n- Ask the landlord for the apartment\u2019s rent\u2011registration information.  \n- Contact New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR) or NYC Housing Preservation & Development (HPD).

Outside NYC, there is no general rent-control regime.\n\nNotes and context:\n- In NYC, most regulated rentals are under rent stabilization, not rent control. Rent stabilization covers many buildings (often pre-1974 construction or properties that received benefits) and is Administered by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).\n- A few municipalities outside NYC have local rent stabilization under the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (ETPA), but these programs are limited and not widespread.\n- If you want to know whether a specific unit is rent-controlled or rent-stabilized, check with the landlord and contact NYC DHCR or HPD, or call 311 for city information.

Most older units are now under rent stabilization, not rent control.\n- A unit is rent controlled only if the building and unit remained under the old rent-control regime (generally from buildings that were in rent control before the regime changed). If the unit is not in one of those very few qualifying buildings, it won\u2019t be rent controlled.\n- A tenant\u2019s length of occupancy does not make a unit rent controlled. The status is about the building and its regulatory history, not how many years you\u2019ve lived there.\n\nHow to check your unit\u2019s status:\n- Ask your landlord for the official regulatory status of your apartment (whether it\u2019s Old Law Rent Control, Rent Stabilized (New Law), or neither).\n- Look up the building in the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) Rent Information Portal by address. It can indicate whether the unit is rent stabilized or, if applicable, \u201cOld Law\u201d (rent controlled).\n- If you can\u2019t find it online, you can contact DHCR or NYC 311 for assistance, or consult a housing attorney to interpret the status.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your building address and I can guide you through where to look up the status and what terms to expect (Old Law Rent Control vs. Rent Stabilized).",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "You've hit on a common misconception! In NYC, whether an apartment qualifies as **rent controlled** is not determined by how long *you* have lived there.\n\nRent control is a very old and rare form of rent regulation in NYC. For an apartment to be rent controlled, it must meet very specific historical criteria:\n\n1.  **Building Age:** The building must have been built before February 1, 1947.\n2.  **Continuous Occupancy:** The tenant (or their lawful successor) must have been living in that apartment continuously since **July 1, 1971**.\n\nIf an apartment became vacant after June 30, 1971, it generally converted to rent stabilization (if the building has six or more units). This is why rent-controlled apartments are so rare today; they are typically occupied by long-term, often elderly, tenants or their family members who have inherited the tenancy.\n\n**In summary, there is no length of time *you* need to have lived in an apartment for it to qualify as rent controlled. The apartment's rent-controlled status is based on its history and the continuous occupancy of a tenant (or their successor) since 1971.**\n\n**Important Distinction: Rent Control vs. Rent Stabilization**\n\nMany people use \"rent control\" generically when they actually mean **rent stabilization**. Rent stabilization is far more common in NYC. Like rent control, its status is not determined by how long *you* have lived there, but by the building's characteristics:\n\n*   Buildings built between 1947 and 1974 with six or more units.\n*   Buildings built before 1947 with six or more units that were not rent controlled.\n*   Buildings that received certain tax abatements (like J-51 or 421-a).\n\n**How to Check Your Apartment's Status:**\n\n*   **Your Lease:** Your lease should state if your apartment is rent stabilized. It will not typically state if it's rent controlled, as those are very specific historical tenancies.\n*   **DHCR Website:** You can check the rent history of your apartment on the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR) website. This is the agency that oversees rent regulation.\n*   **Contact DHCR:** You can call or write to DHCR for assistance in determining your apartment's status.\n\nIf you believe your apartment should be rent regulated, it's best to check with the DHCR.",
            "llama3": "Rent control laws vary by jurisdiction, but generally, you'll need to meet certain criteria to qualify. Here are some common scenarios:\n\n1. **New York City**: In NYC, rent stabilization applies if you've lived in your apartment continuously since April 1, 1997 (or earlier). To be eligible for rent control, you must have occupied the unit since October 20, 1971.\n2. **California**: In California, rent control typically kicks in after a certain period of tenancy. For example:\n\t* In San Francisco, rent control applies if you've lived in your apartment continuously since June 7, 1980.\n\t* In Los Angeles, rent control applies if you've occupied the unit continuously since September 1, 1978.\n3. **Other cities**: Rent control laws vary by city and state. Check with your local housing authority or landlord for specific guidelines.\n\nIn general, to qualify for rent control:\n\n1. You must have a written lease agreement (oral agreements may not be recognized).\n2. Your tenancy must have begun before the effective date of rent control in your area.\n3. You must have continuously occupied the apartment since then (with some exceptions, like military service or temporary absences).\n\nKeep in mind that even if you meet these criteria, there might be specific circumstances under which your rent can increase, such as:\n\n* A landlord's application for a rent increase due to renovations or other legitimate reasons.\n* Your rent being adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n* Changes to local rent control laws.\n\nTo confirm your eligibility and understand any specific rules in your area, consult with your landlord, a tenant advocate, or contact your local housing authority."

In almost all cases, when a rent\u2011controlled tenant in NYC permanently moves out, the apartment\u2019s rent control status ends.\n\nWhat typically happens next:\n\n1. **If the building has 6+ units and is otherwise subject to rent stabilization**  \n   - The apartment usually becomes **rent\u2011stabilized**, not rent\u2011controlled.  \n   - The landlord can set a new legal regulated rent following the rules in place at the time of vacancy (as of 2019, big vacancy bonuses and luxury deregulation are no longer allowed, but there are still rules around setting the first stabilized rent for a former rent\u2011controlled unit).  \n   - Future rent increases are then governed by the Rent Guidelines Board and rent stabilization laws.\n\n2. **If the building is not subject to rent stabilization**  \n   - If it\u2019s a small building, or otherwise exempt, the unit may become **market-rate** once the rent\u2011controlled tenant permanently vacates.\n\n3. **Exception \u2013 Succession rights**  \n   - If a qualifying family member (or another person with succession rights) has been living in the apartment as their primary residence for the required period, they may be able to remain as a **rent\u2011controlled** tenant or as a regulated tenant (sometimes the status shifts depending on the building and circumstances).  \n   - In that case, the apartment does not \u201cvacate\u201d legally, so rent control can continue.\n\nKey points under NYC / NYS law:\n- Rent control is generally tied to very long\u2011term tenancies that began before July 1, 1971.  \n- Once the last rent\u2011controlled tenant (without a successor) permanently leaves, **rent control on that unit ends**.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- the number of units in the building,  \n- whether other apartments there are rent\u2011stabilized or market rate,  \nI can explain what\u2019s likely to happen to **your specific** apartment under current rules.",

If a rent\u2011controlled tenant permanently vacates, the unit normally ceases to be rent\u2011controlled for the next unrelated tenant.\n\nKey points to know\n- Rent control protects the tenant (and certain successors), not the unit permanently. When the qualifying tenant permanently moves out or no qualifying successor remains, the apartment will no longer be rent\u2011controlled.\n- Exceptions:\n  - Succession: a surviving spouse, parent, child or other family member who lived with the tenant for the required period (usually at least two years) may qualify as a successor and keep the rent\u2011controlled status.\n  - Temporary absences (hospitalization, military service, travel with intent to return) do not necessarily end rent\u2011control rights \u2014 intent to return matters.\n- After vacancy: once the unit ceases to be rent\u2011controlled it may convert to rent\u2011stabilized status if the building is subject to rent stabilization, or it may become subject to other rules (or be deregulated) depending on the building and the legal rent. Landlords cannot simply treat it as rent controlled for an unrelated new tenant unless a succession applies.\n- If you want a particular person to take over as a successor, they must meet the legal succession requirements. Simply having someone move in does not preserve rent control.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Check the apartment\u2019s rent history/registration with New York State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR) / Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or call them to confirm current status.\n- If there\u2019s a dispute about succession or vacancy, consult a tenants\u2019 rights organization or a housing attorney.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether the tenant is moving out, died, or who the prospective next occupant is, and I can point to the likely outcome and next steps.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: no. Rent control does not automatically stay with the apartment for the next tenant.\n\nWhat usually happens when a rent-controlled unit becomes vacant:\n- The unit generally loses its rent-controlled status after vacancy.\n- The landlord may re-rent the unit either as a rent-stabilized unit (if the building is subject to rent stabilization) or at market rate if the building isn\u2019t stabilized.\n\nKey points:\n- Rent control is very limited in NYC today and is tied to the current occupant. Vacancy typically ends the rent-controlled status.\n- If the building is covered by rent stabilization, a vacated unit is usually re-rented at a stabilized rent under the Rent Stabilization rules (with annual increases set by the Rent Guidelines Board).\n- If the building is not under rent stabilization, the next tenant can be charged market-rate rent.\n\nWhat you can do to verify:\n- Check the building\u2019s status with the NYS DHCR (Rent Stabilization Registry) or ask the landlord for the current rent stabilized status and the unit\u2019s rent history.\n- You can contact DHCR or NYC HPD for guidance or to look up whether the building is registered as rent-stabilized.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me the address and I can outline the likely status and next steps for verification.

It does not remain rent controlled.\n\n**The only significant exception to this rule is if a qualified family member has the right to succeed to the tenancy.**\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Voluntary Vacancy:** If the current rent-controlled tenant moves out and no one qualifies for succession, the apartment becomes rent stabilized for the next tenant. Rent control is a very old system designed to protect long-term, continuous tenancies, and it generally ends when that continuous tenancy ends.\n\n2.  **Succession Rights:** If a \"qualified family member\" (such as a spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, etc.) has been living with the rent-controlled tenant in the apartment as their primary residence for a specified period (typically two years, or one year if the successor is elderly or disabled), they may have the right to \"succeed\" to the tenancy.\n    *   **In this specific succession scenario, the apartment *does* remain rent controlled for the successor.** The successor essentially steps into the shoes of the original tenant.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nFor a new, unrelated tenant moving in after a rent-controlled tenant moves out, the apartment will almost certainly be rent stabilized, not rent controlled. Rent control is extremely rare and applies to a very specific, dwindling number of apartments where the tenant (or their family) has been in continuous occupancy since before July 1, 1971.\n\nIf you are considering moving into an apartment that was previously rent controlled, it's crucial to understand that it will almost certainly be rent stabilized for you, with different rules regarding rent increases and lease renewals. Always verify the apartment's status with the landlord and, if possible, with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), which oversees rent regulation.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, rent control and rent stabilization regulations are tied to the specific apartment unit and not the building or landlord. So, if you move out of a rent-controlled apartment, the new tenant will likely inherit the same rent-controlled status.\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n1. **The rent-controlled status follows the apartment**: When you vacate the apartment, your lease ends, and the new tenant takes over. Since the apartment itself is still under rent control, the new tenant inherits the existing rent-controlled status.\n2. **The landlord must continue to offer the apartment at the controlled rent**: The landlord is required to continue offering the apartment at the same rent that was in effect when you moved out (or a slightly higher rent, as allowed by the Rent Guidelines Board).\n3. **The new tenant may need to re-certify income and household size**: If the new tenant has different income or household size than you did, they'll likely need to provide updated information to the NYC Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to maintain the rent-controlled status.\n4. **The rent can still be increased annually**: Like with any rent-controlled apartment, the landlord can apply for an annual rent increase, as allowed by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n\nIt's worth noting that if the new tenant is not a family member or someone who has lived with you in the same household for at least two years, they may need to re-certify their income and household size. This ensures that the apartment remains available to low-income households and helps maintain the integrity of the rent control system.\n\nRemember that rent control regulations can be complex, so it's always a good idea to consult with an attorney or real estate expert if you have specific questions about your situation."

These annual increases continue until the current rent reaches the established MBR.\n4.  **Reaching the MBR:** Once the actual rent reaches the MBR, it stays at that level until a new, higher MBR is established in the next two-year cycle, and the landlord can again apply the annual percentage increases towards that new MBR.\n\nIt's important to distinguish this from rent-stabilized apartments, where the Rent Guidelines Board sets annual percentage increases for lease renewals directly.

Here\u2019s how it usually works under NYC law:\n\n**General rule (pre-1974 buildings):**  \nMost buildings in NYC that:\n- Were built before January 1, 1974, **and**\n- Have **6 or more residential units**,  \nare supposed to be covered by rent stabilization, **unless** an exemption applies.\n\nYour building:\n- Built in **1960** \u2192 within the usual rent stabilization time frame.  \n- Has **10 units** \u2192 above the 6\u2011unit threshold.\n\nSo by the basic rule, your building *sounds* like it should be rent stabilized.\n\nHowever, there are important exceptions / reasons why a specific apartment might **not** be stabilized:\n\n- The building may have had **substantial rehabilitation** after 1974 (if it met specific DHCR standards, it can be exempt).  \n- Your unit could be in a building that\u2019s a **co\u2011op or condo** with certain conditions.  \n- The unit might be in a building that used **tax benefit programs** (like 421\u2011a or J\u201151) and then lost coverage when the benefits expired.  \n- In rare cases, there may have been a lawful **deregulation** in the past (though high\u2011rent/high\u2011income deregulation was eliminated in 2019, some older deregulations might still matter historically).  \n- The building could have fewer than 6 *legal* units on the Certificate of Occupancy, even if there are 10 physical apartments.\n\n**How to check your specific apartment:**\n\n1. **Look up the building with HPD & DOB:**\n   - HPD Building Registration:  \n     https://hpdonline.nyc.gov  \n   - DOB\u2019s BIS or DOB NOW:  \n     https://www.nyc.gov/buildings  \n   Check:\n   - Number of **registered units**  \n   - Year built  \n   - Notes on \u201crent regulated\u201d or similar.\n\n2. **Request your rent history from DHCR:**\n   - Call DHCR Rent Info Line: (718) 739\u20116400  \n   - Or use the form here:  \n     https://hcr.ny.gov/asking-dhcr-your-rent-history  \n   Ask for your **full rent history** back to 1984.  \n   If DHCR shows \u201cRS\u201d or \u201cRent Stabilized\u201d and a legal regulated rent, that\u2019s strong evidence your unit is stabilized.\n\n3. **Check your lease/renewals:**\n   - Stabilized leases must use the **DHCR rent\u2011stabilized rider** and offer **1- or 2\u2011year renewals** on set timelines.\n   - If you\u2019ve been getting those, that supports stabilized status.\n\n4. **Consult help if the records are unclear:**\n   - Call a tenants\u2019 rights group (e.g., Met Council on Housing, Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC) or a tenant lawyer.\n   - Many offer free advice; bring:\n     - DHCR rent history  \n     - Your leases  \n     - HPD/DOB printouts\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Your building\u2019s exact number of apartments per HPD/DOB,\n- Whether your lease has a DHCR rider,\nand I can walk you through how likely it is that *your* unit is stabilized and what to do next.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: very likely, but not automatic.\n\nWhy: Under New York rent\u2011regulation rules, most NYC buildings with six or more apartment units that were built between Feb. 1, 1947 and Jan. 1, 1974 are covered by rent stabilization. A 10\u2011unit building built in 1960 generally falls into that category, so apartments in that building are usually rent\u2011stabilized.\n\nImportant caveats and exceptions:\n- Individual units can have different histories. If a particular unit was deregulated in the past (before the 2019 rent\u2011law changes) it might remain deregulated.\n- Buildings converted to condos/coops, substantially rehabilitated under certain programs, or receiving particular tax/financing treatment can have different rules.\n- Some units might be rent\u2011controlled instead of rent\u2011stabilized (rent control applies to tenants in occupancy since before July 1, 1971).\n- Owner-occupied small building rules and other narrow exceptions may affect status (less likely for a 10\u2011unit building).\n\nHow to confirm:\n- Ask your landlord or management for the \u201crent\u2011stabilization rider\u201d in your lease and for proof that the unit is registered as rent\u2011stabilized.\n- Get the official rent history / registration for your unit from New York State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR) \u2014 they have an online rent history/registration lookup and can issue an official rent history on request.\n- If you\u2019re unsure or run into resistance from your landlord, contact HCR/DHCR or a local tenant rights organization or housing attorney for help.\n\nIf you want, tell me the borough and whether your building received any tax benefits or was converted to condos/coop, and I can suggest the best next step or show how to request the official rent history.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: not guaranteed, but likely.\n\n- In NYC, rent stabilization usually covers most rental buildings built before 1974 with 6 or more residential units. A 10-unit building from 1960 is the kind of building that often has stabilized units.\n- However, there are important exemptions and variations. A unit may be exempt or may have become decontrolled if certain conditions apply (for example, if the building has certain tax-incentive exemptions, if the unit was converted to a cooperative/condo, or in some cases after a vacancy when rents reach a threshold). So you can\u2019t assume every unit is stabilized just because the building is older.\n\nHow to check your specific unit\u2019s status\n\n- Look at your lease: does it say \u201crent-stabilized lease\u201d or include any stabilization language?\n- Ask your landlord or property manager for the rent registration details (the official DHCR/RSL registration numbers or a copy of the registration). Landlords in NYC are required to register stabilized apartments.\n- Check with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) Rent Lookup tool to see if your address/unit is registered as stabilized. You can also call or write to DHCR for confirmation.\n- If you\u2019re unsure or have disputes, consider reaching out to a tenants\u2019 rights clinic, Legal Aid, or a local housing attorney.\n\nIf you want, tell me your building\u2019s address (or just the unit\u2019s lease status if you have it), and I can guide you through the exact steps to verify using official sources. Note: I can\u2019t provide legal advice, but I can help you navigate the process.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, based on the information you've provided, it is **highly likely** that your apartment is rent stabilized.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Building Age:** The Rent Stabilization Law generally applies to buildings built before **January 1, 1974**. Your building was built in 1960, which falls well within this timeframe. (The original Rent Stabilization Law applied to buildings built before June 30, 1971, but the date was later extended to 1974 for certain purposes, and 1974 is the commonly cited cutoff for general applicability).\n2.  **Number of Units:** The Rent Stabilization Law applies to buildings with **six or more units**. Your building has 10 units, which meets this criterion.\n\n**However, there are a few exceptions or scenarios where it might *not* be rent stabilized, even with these facts:**\n\n*   **Co-op or Condo Conversion:** If the building was converted to a co-op or condominium, your specific apartment would generally not be rent stabilized *unless* you were a tenant in occupancy at the time of the conversion and chose to remain as a non-purchasing tenant.\n*   **Non-Profit Ownership:** Some buildings owned by specific non-profit organizations may be exempt.\n*   **Previous Legal Decontrol (Pre-2019):** Before the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA), units could be legally decontrolled due to high rent and high-income tenants (luxury decontrol) or if the tenant voluntarily vacated after the rent reached a certain threshold. While HSTPA largely eliminated these pathways for decontrol, it's *possible* a unit was legally decontrolled *before* June 14, 2019.\n*   **Tax Abatements (J-51 or 421-a):** While these tax abatements often *create* rent stabilization for buildings that wouldn't otherwise be stabilized (e.g., newer construction), it's less common for a 1960 building to *lose* stabilization due to them. In fact, if a 1960 building received a J-51 tax abatement for renovations, it would *reinforce* its rent-stabilized status for the duration of the abatement.\n\n**How to Confirm Your Apartment's Status:**\n\n1.  **Check Your Lease:** Your lease should state whether the apartment is rent stabilized, and you should receive a rent stabilization rider.\n2.  **DHCR Rent History:** You can request a rent history for your apartment from the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR), which is the agency that oversees rent stabilization. This is the most definitive way to confirm. You can do this online or by mail.\n3.  **Contact DHCR:** You can call the DHCR Tenant Protection Unit (TPU) for assistance.\n4.  **Consult a Housing Attorney:** If you have any doubts or encounter resistance from your landlord, a housing attorney specializing in NYC law can help you determine your status and assert your rights.\n\nGiven your building's age and number of units, the strong presumption is that your apartment *is* rent stabilized.",
            "llama3": "A great question about NYC real estate!\n\nIn New York City, rent stabilization laws were enacted to control the rapid rise of rents in the post-war era. The Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (RL-11) and the Loft Board Law of 1982 (LL-3) are two key laws that affect rent regulation.\n\nTo determine if your apartment is rent stabilized, consider the following:\n\n1. **Building construction date**: If your building was built before January 1, 1974, it's more likely to be rent stabilized.\n2. **Apartment type**: Only certain types of apartments are eligible for rent stabilization:\n\t* Studio apartments (also known as efficiency apartments)\n\t* One-bedroom apartments\n\t* Two-bedroom apartments\n\t* Apartments with no more than two bedrooms, regardless of the number of units in the building\n3. **Lease terms**: Rent-stabilized leases typically have specific provisions and restrictions.\n4. **Rent Commission registration**: The New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) registers rent-stabilized apartments. You can check if your building is registered on the RGB's website.\n\nBased on your information, since your building was built in 1960 and has 10 units, it's likely that your apartment could be rent stabilized. However, to confirm, you should:\n\n1. Review your lease agreement: Check your original lease or any subsequent leases for language indicating rent stabilization.\n2. Contact the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD): They can help determine if your building is registered with them.\n3. Contact the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB): The RGB maintains a database of rent-stabilized apartments. They may be able to verify whether your apartment is rent stabilized.\n\nKeep in mind that even if your apartment is rent stabilized, you're still required to pay market-rate rent for the first year after vacancy or when a new tenant takes over the lease. After that, the rent can only be increased by the amount allowed by law.\n\nI hope this helps!"

The key date you\u2019re thinking of (June 30, 1971) is often misunderstood.\n\nFor **\u201cpre\u20111947\u201d buildings**, the usual rule is:\n\n- **Buildings built before 1/1/1947**:\n  - **Rent Control** generally applies to tenants (or their lawful successors) who have been in continuous occupancy since before July 1, 1971.\n  - **Rent Stabilization** generally applies to *other* apartments in those buildings that:\n    - Are not rent\u2011controlled, and  \n    - Are in a building with **6 or more residential units**, and  \n    - Are not otherwise exempt (e.g., high\u2011rent vacancy deregulation when that was still allowed, substantial rehab, cooperative/condo with certain conditions, owner\u2011occupied 1\u20135 family, etc.).\n\nYour **move\u2011in date (after 1971)** does **not** by itself disqualify the apartment from rent stabilization.

However, there are important exceptions that can make a pre\u20111947 apartment rent\u2011stabilized.\n\nWhat the law says (brief):\n- Rent control applies only to continuous occupancy since before July 1, 1971 in buildings built before Feb. 1, 1947. Since you moved in after 1971, you are not rent\u2011controlled.\n- Rent stabilization generally covers buildings built between Feb. 1, 1947 and Jan. 1, 1974 with six or more units, but a building of any age can be subject to rent stabilization if the owner accepted certain public subsidies or tax/finance programs that require stabilization (for example, some J\u201151 abatements, Section 8 or other regulatory agreements, certain tax incentive programs). In that case the owner must register units as rent\u2011stabilized during the period of the benefit.\n\nHow to check your apartment\u2019s status:\n1. Ask the landlord in writing whether your unit is rent\u2011stabilized and for a copy of the lease rider or regulatory agreement (if any).\n2. Request a rent history / rent registration from NY State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). HCR can tell you whether the unit is registered as rent\u2011stabilized and what the legally registered rent is.\n3. Look at your lease for a Rent Stabilization Rider (or language saying the apartment is subject to a regulatory agreement).\n4. If the landlord refuses or you suspect wrongful deregulation, contact HCR or a tenant attorney/tenant helpline (NYC Legal Aid, Tenant Protection, community organizations).\n\nIf you want, tell me the building address and approximate number of units and whether the owner has given you a lease rider or any tax\u2011abatement language, and I can suggest the most likely status and next steps.",

A pre-1947 building in NYC can be rent-stabilized, but it isn\u2019t automatic.\n\nKey points:\n- Rent stabilization in NYC typically covers buildings with 6+ units that are subject to the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) or the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (ETPA). The building\u2019s age (pre-1947) helps explain why many units are stabilized, but it\u2019s not enough by itself.\n- There are important exceptions that can make a unit not stabilized:\n  - If the building is owner-occupied (often a 1-, 2-, or 3-family house) and exempt.\n  - If the building was converted to a condo/co-op.\n  - If a unit became deregulated upon vacancy (vacancy decontrol) or is otherwise not under stabilization due to specific exemptions or changes in status.\n  - Some newer-converted or substantially rehabbed units may have different treatment, depending on timing and rules.\n- The only reliable way to know your unit\u2019s status is to verify with DHCR (the state housing agency) or via documents from your landlord.\n\nWhat you can do to check:\n- Ask your landlord for the current rent registration certificate for your unit (DHCR Form RSR-1 or equivalent).

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, an apartment in a pre-1947 NYC building **can absolutely be rent stabilized**, even if you moved in after 1971. In fact, this is one of the most common scenarios for rent stabilization in New York City.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why and what factors determine it:\n\n**Key Criteria for Rent Stabilization:**\n\n1.  **Building Age:** The building was built before January 1, 1974. Your \"pre-1947\" building fits this criterion perfectly.\n2.  **Number of Units:** The building must contain **six or more** residential units. This is a crucial point. If your building has 1-5 units, it is generally *not* rent stabilized (unless it received certain tax abatements, see below).\n3.  **Location:** The building must be in New York City.\n\n**Why \"Moved in after 1971\" Doesn't Prevent Stabilization:**\n\n*   **Rent Control vs. Rent Stabilization:** The \"1971\" date is primarily relevant for **rent control**, which is a much older and stricter form of regulation. To be rent controlled, a tenant (or their family) generally needs to have been living in the apartment continuously since before July 1, 1971.\n*   **Rent Stabilization Law:** The Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) came into effect in 1969. Many apartments in buildings meeting the age and unit count criteria became rent stabilized at that time, or when a rent-controlled tenant moved out, or when the building received certain tax benefits. Your move-in date after 1971 simply means you wouldn't be rent controlled, but you could very well be rent stabilized.\n\n**Important Exceptions and Considerations (Why an apartment *might not* be stabilized):**\n\nEven if your building is pre-1947 and has 6+ units, there are some reasons an apartment might *not* be stabilized:\n\n*   **Luxury Decontrol (largely eliminated by HSTPA 2019):** Before the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA), apartments could be \"decontrolled\" if the rent reached a certain high threshold *and* the tenant's income was above a certain amount. HSTPA largely eliminated this mechanism, meaning apartments that were stabilized before 2019 generally remain stabilized, and new decontrol based on rent/income is no longer possible. However, an apartment *could* have been legally decontrolled *before* HSTPA.\n*   **Co-op/Condo Conversion:** If the building was converted to a co-op or condominium, the apartments sold to owners are no longer rent stabilized. However, any \"non-purchasing tenants\" who were in occupancy before the conversion may retain their stabilization rights.\n*   **Substantial Rehabilitation:** If the building underwent a \"substantial rehabilitation\" after 1974, it might be exempt from stabilization, but this is a high legal bar to meet.\n*   **Specific Exemptions:** Certain types of housing (e.g., dorms, hospitals, temporary housing) are exempt.\n\n**Other Ways an Apartment Can Be Rent Stabilized (Even if it doesn't meet the age/unit count):**\n\n*   **J-51 Tax Abatement:** If a building receives a J-51 tax abatement for renovations, all apartments in that building become rent stabilized for the duration of the abatement period, plus a certain number of years after. This can apply to buildings of any age or size (though less common for small buildings).\n*   **421-a Tax Abatement:** This applies to new construction. Buildings receiving a 421-a tax abatement have their apartments rent stabilized for the duration of the abatement period.\n\n**How to Confirm if Your Apartment is Rent Stabilized:**\n\nThe most definitive way to find out is to request your apartment's rent history from the **New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR)**, the agency that oversees rent regulation. You can do this online or by mail. This history will show if the apartment has ever been registered as rent stabilized and its registered rents over time.\n\n**In summary:** Your pre-1947 building is a prime candidate for rent stabilization. The key is whether it has 6 or more units and hasn't been legally removed from stabilization for one of the reasons mentioned above. Your move-in date after 1971 does not prevent it from being stabilized.",
            "llama3": "The eternal question of NYC rent stabilization!\n\nTo answer your query, it depends on several factors. Here's a general overview:\n\n**Pre-1947 buildings:** If you live in an apartment in a building that was constructed before 1947, your apartment is **automatically rent-stabilized**, regardless of when you moved in.\n\n**Post-1971 move-in:** Since you moved into the apartment after 1971, your apartment will not be automatically rent-stabilized. However...\n\n**Rent stabilization can still apply:** If the building was converted to a rent-stabilized building before you moved in (or if it's already a rent-stabilized building), and you've been living there for at least one year, your apartment may still be **rent-stabilized**.\n\nHere are some scenarios:\n\n1. **Original rent stabilization:** If the building was converted to a rent-stabilized building before 1971, all apartments in that building became rent-stabilized. In this case, even if you moved in after 1971, your apartment is still rent-stabilized.\n2. **Conversion to rent stabilization after 1971:** If the building was not rent-stabilized when you moved in (pre-1947) but was converted to a rent-stabilized building after 1971, your apartment may have become rent-stabilized at that time.\n\nTo determine whether your apartment is rent-stabilized, check your lease or rental agreement. If it doesn't specify \"rent-stabilized\" or \"rent controlled,\" you can:\n\n* Contact your landlord to ask if the building is rent-stabilized and what the rent regulations are.\n* Check with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) or the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) to see if the building is listed as rent-stabilized.\n\nKeep in mind that even if your apartment is not automatically rent-stabilized, you may still be eligible for rent regulation under other programs, such as **rent control** or **rent regulation**."

This period is known as the \"guidelines year.\"\n\n2.  **Application to a Specific Lease:**\n    *   The specific RGB rate that applies to a tenant's renewal lease is the one that is in effect **on the date the new renewal lease term begins.**\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's assume the RGB votes in June 2023 for rates effective October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Lease Commencing On or After October 1st**\n    *   If a tenant's current lease expires on **September 30, 2023**, and their renewal lease begins on **October 1, 2023**, the *new* RGB rates (voted in June 2023) would apply.\n    *   Similarly, if a lease expires on December 31, 2023, and the renewal begins January 1, 2024, the new rates (voted June 2023) would apply.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Lease Commencing Before October 1st**\n    *   If a tenant's current lease expires on **August 31, 2023**, and their renewal lease begins on **September 1, 2023**, the *previous* RGB rates (voted in June 2022, applicable Oct 1, 2022 - Sept 30, 2023) would apply. This is true even though the RGB had already voted on the new rates in June 2023, because the renewal lease's commencement date falls within the *previous* guidelines year.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Rent-Stabilized Only:** These rules apply exclusively to rent-stabilized apartments.\n*   **Lease Offer Period:** Landlords are required to offer a renewal lease between 90 and 150 days before the expiration of the current lease.\n*   **Tenant's Choice:** Tenants have 60 days from the date of the offer to accept the renewal.\n*   **1-Year vs. 2-Year:** The RGB sets different rates for 1-year and 2-year renewal leases.\n\nIn essence, it's the **start date of the renewal lease** that dictates which set of RGB rates will be used to calculate the rent increase.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, the rent guideline board's annual rent increase rates are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and are effective as of October 1st of each year.\n\nFor renewal leases, the increased rent takes effect when the new lease term begins. If a tenant is renewing their lease for another year, the landlord must apply the increased rent to the new lease term starting from the date it begins. This means that if your current lease ends on June 30th and you're renewing it for another year, you'll likely see the increased rent take effect on July 1st (the first day of the new lease term).\n\nHere's a rough breakdown:\n\n* October: The NYC Rent Guidelines Board announces the annual rent increase rate.\n* January to September: The increased rent doesn't apply, as your current lease remains in effect.\n* October 1st: The increased rent takes effect for all renewal leases that begin on or after this date.\n* Anytime during the year: If a tenant is renewing their lease, the increased rent applies when the new lease term begins.\n\nKeep in mind that these dates apply to most renewal leases. However, if you're negotiating a new lease with your landlord, be sure to clarify the effective date of the increased rent as part of your agreement."

Lawful ways are limited and include things like:  \n   - The entire building becomes permanently exempt (e.g., certain small-owner-occupied buildings under specific conditions, or some types of government\u2011approved conversions).  \n   - Expiration and non\u2011renewal of certain tax benefit programs *combined with* conditions that allow exemption (and even those rules are now much stricter).  \n   These are narrow, technical situations\u2014not the normal case of a tenant just moving out.\n\nIf you want, I can help you check whether DHCR lists your apartment as rent-stabilized and what the last registered legal rent is, and walk you through what to do if the owner is trying to claim it\u2019s now \u201cmarket rate.\u201d",

If the new rent is at or below that threshold, the unit stays rent-stabilized. If it\u2019s above, the unit can become deregulated at the vacancy.\n\nKey points to know\n- The threshold changes every year. Check the current amount on the NYS DHCR website or the NYC Rent Guidelines Board site.\n- The landlord must set the new rent at or above that threshold and file the necessary deregulation paperwork with DHCR to remove stabilization.\n- If the rent on vacancy does not meet the threshold, the apartment remains rent-stabilized and the protections continue.\n- There can be nuances involving \u201cpreferential rents\u201d and the exact way the \u201clegal rent\u201d is calculated, so it\u2019s worth confirming with DHCR or a housing attorney if you\u2019re in that situation.\n- Not all buildings/units are eligible for vacancy deregulation; eligibility depends on the specific RS status of the building and unit.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Ask the landlord for the most recent rent registration and the intended new rent for the vacancy.\n- Check DHCR\u2019s resources or call their rent-info line to confirm whether the unit is currently stabilized and whether the proposed new rent would trigger deregulation.\n- You can also look up the unit\u2019s status on DHCR\u2019s public data tools if you want to verify.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you check the current vacancy-dereglation threshold and look up the unit\u2019s status with DHCR\u2014just share the building address or unit details (and whether you\u2019re the landlord, tenant, or prospective tenant).

The HSTPA **eliminated this provision entirely.**\n2.  **Elimination of Vacancy Bonus:** The HSTPA also eliminated the \"vacancy bonus,\" which allowed landlords to significantly increase the rent (often by 20%) when a new tenant moved into a vacant apartment. This bonus often helped push rents over the deregulation threshold.\n\n**What this means for your vacant rent-stabilized apartment:**\n\n*   **It remains rent-stabilized.** The owner is obligated to re-rent it as a rent-stabilized apartment.\n*   **Rent Increases:** The owner can still apply for rent increases based on:\n    *   **Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) increases:** For new leases, the rent can be increased by the percentages set by the RGB.\n    *   **Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs):** If the owner makes significant improvements to the apartment (e.g., new kitchen, bathroom), they can apply for a temporary rent increase. However, HSTPA significantly capped these increases and made them temporary (amortized over 15-18 years, after which the increase is removed from the rent).\n    *   **Major Capital Improvements (MCIs):** If the owner makes building-wide improvements (ee.g., new roof, boiler), they can apply for a rent increase across all affected units.\n\n**In summary:** The days of a rent-stabilized apartment becoming deregulated just because it's empty and hits a certain rent threshold are over in NYC. The apartment retains its rent-stabilized status.",
            "llama3": "The thrill of a newly vacant rental unit!\n\nIn New York City, a rent-stabilized apartment can become deregulated under certain circumstances, including vacancy. However, it's not a straightforward process. Here are the key factors to consider:\n\n1. **Vacancy bonus**: If your landlord has been renting out the apartment continuously for at least six months prior to the vacancy, they may be eligible for a \"vacancy bonus\" of 20% on the stabilized rent. This means that if the stabilized rent is $2,000 per month, the new rent would be $2,400 per month.\n2. **High-income deregulation**: If your landlord can demonstrate that the apartment has been occupied by tenants who earn at least 125% of the annual median income (AMI) for the area, they may be able to deregulate the unit under the \"high-income\" exception. For example, in Manhattan, AMI is around $114,000 per year.\n3. **Vacancy decontrol**: If the apartment has been vacant for more than six months, your landlord may be able to petition the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) to deregulate the unit under a process called \"vacancy decontrol.\" This requires proof that the apartment was vacant for at least 12 consecutive months and that no rent-stabilized tenants have occupied it during that time.\n\nTo determine whether your landlord can deregulate the apartment, you should:\n\n1. Check your lease: Review your original lease agreement to see if there are any provisions related to vacancy or deregulation.\n2. Research the law: Familiarize yourself with New York City's rent regulation laws and guidelines (RR 252/2015) to understand the eligibility criteria for deregulation.\n3. Consult an attorney: If you're concerned about potential deregulation, consider consulting a tenant lawyer who can provide guidance on your specific situation.\n\nRemember that as a rent-stabilized tenant, you have certain rights and protections under New York City law. Be prepared to advocate for yourself if you believe your landlord is attempting to unfairly deregulate the apartment."

An apartment that is rent-stabilized remains rent-stabilized even when vacant, absent some special reason (e.g., certain types of regulatory agreements, co-op/condo conversions under specific rules, owner-occupied small buildings with exemptions, etc.).\n\n5. **Key takeaway for you**  \n   - If you are currently in a rent-stabilized apartment and there was **no final DHCR luxury deregulation order issued before June 14, 2019**, your landlord **cannot deregulate your apartment now** based on your rent amount or your income.  \n   - They also cannot legally pressure you to leave on the claim that your income makes the apartment deregulated.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Whether you know your apartment is rent-stabilized,  \n- Approximate date you moved in, and  \n- Whether your landlord has mentioned DHCR or a \u201cluxury deregulation\u201d notice,\n\nand I can walk you through exactly what to check (rent history, DHCR status, etc.) for your specific situation.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: No \u2014 if your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized in New York City, it cannot be deregulated just because the rent got high or because your household income is high.\n\nWhy: The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 ended the long-standing \u201chigh\u2011rent/high\u2011income\u201d and vacancy decontrol rules for rent\u2011stabilized apartments. Since that law took effect (June 2019), reaching a certain legal regulated rent or having a household income above a threshold no longer causes a rent\u2011stabilized apartment to lose its protection.\n\nWhat this means for you\n- If your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized, your landlord cannot deregulate it solely because the rent or your income went up. The apartment should remain stabilized even if the legal regulated rent is high or your household earns over previous thresholds.  \n- If your apartment is not rent\u2011stabilized (for example: it was never covered because it was built after the applicable cutoff date, it\u2019s a market\u2011rate unit, or it was legally deregulated before current law), those protections don\u2019t apply \u2014 it\u2019s already unregulated and there\u2019s nothing to \u201cderegister.\u201d\n\nHow to confirm and what to do if your landlord claims deregulation\n1. Get the rent history. Request an apartment rent history from New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). That shows whether the unit has been registered as rent\u2011stabilized and lists legal regulated rents.  \n2. Check your lease and rent registration. Look for a rent\u2011stabilization clause in the lease and ask the landlord for documentation of rent\u2011stabilized status and registration with HCR. Landlords are required to register stabilized apartments.  \n3. If your landlord says the apartment is being deregulated or threatens eviction for this reason, don\u2019t accept it. File a complaint with HCR (they enforce rent\u2011stabilization rules) and consider contacting a tenant lawyer or a tenant help organization (Legal Aid, local community groups or 311 for referrals).  \n4. Keep records. Save rent receipts, lease copies, correspondence with the landlord, and any offers or notices.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- whether your lease says \u201crent\u2011stabilized\u201d or the building has 6+ units and was built before 1974, and  \n- whether the landlord gave any written notice claiming deregulation \u2014\n\nand I can tell you the next specific steps and help draft a letter or complaint.",

Being a high\u2011income or high rent tenant does not by itself \u201cderegulate\u201d your unit while you\u2019re living there.\n\nKey points to know\n- Deregulation is not automatic and generally happens only under limited circumstances.\n- The two main routes people hear about are:\n  - Vacancy deregulation (vacating the apartment so the unit can be removed from stabilization) if the unit\u2019s legal rent and the household income meet thresholds set by law. This used to be a common route, but the rules were tightened in recent years.\n  - Other forms of deregulation that depended on pre\u20112019 law. Since the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) of 2019, many deregulation avenues have been restricted, and the rules are more protective of stabilized units.\n- An occupied unit will not be deregulated just because you or your household income is high. Deregulation generally requires the unit to become vacant or fall under a narrowly defined exception that applies at turnover and under current law.\n\nWhat you should do to understand your specific situation\n- Find out whether your unit is rent-stabilized or rent-controlled.\n  - Ask your landlord for the stabilization status and the current rent history.\n  - Check the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) databases for rent registrations and stabilization status by building/address.\n- Review your lease and any notices from the landlord about stabilization or deregulation.\n- If you\u2019re concerned about deregulation or want a precise answer for your unit, consider contacting a housing attorney, a tenants\u2019 rights nonprofit, or DHCR for an official determination.\n  - DHCR resources: New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (dhcr.ny.gov)\n  - NYC resources: 311 or HPD, and NYC Bar/Legal Aid for tenant procedures\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your building address (or neighborhood) and whether you know if the unit is currently stabilized. I can help you locate the official status and explain what the current thresholds or rules are for deregulation in that case. Note: I can\u2019t give legal advice, but I can point you to the right official sources and explain the general framework.",

It remains rent-stabilized unless another, very specific, and now much rarer, deregulation event occurs.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe mechanisms that allowed landlords to deregulate occupied apartments based on a tenant's rent and income (or just high rent upon vacancy) were eliminated by the 2019 law. If your apartment is currently rent-stabilized, it will remain so, regardless of your income or how high your rent goes, as long as you remain in occupancy.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Other Forms of Deregulation (Rare and Not Income/Rent Based):** While income and rent are no longer factors, an apartment *could* potentially be deregulated under very specific and limited circumstances, such as:\n    *   **Owner Use:** If the owner genuinely intends to occupy the apartment as their primary residence (subject to strict rules and tenant protections).\n    *   **Substantial Rehabilitation:** If the building undergoes a complete gut renovation and meets specific DHCR criteria (very difficult to prove for an occupied unit).\n    *   **Demolition:** If the building is to be demolished (requires permits and relocation assistance).\n    *   **Co-op/Condo Conversion:** Under specific rules, but tenants in occupancy have strong protections.\n    *   **These are not related to your income or rent level.**\n*   **Verify Your Apartment's Status:** If you are unsure whether your apartment is rent-stabilized, you can contact the DHCR (New York State Homes and Community Renewal) or check their online database.\n*   **Be Wary of Landlord Tactics:** Some landlords may try to mislead tenants about their rights. Always know your rights and seek legal advice if you have concerns.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, the rent regulation laws are complex, but I'll try to break it down simply.\n\n**Deregulation Basics**\n\nRent stabilization (RS) and rent control (RC) regulations protect tenants from excessive rent increases. For a building to be deregulated, all of the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. **Primary Residence**: The apartment is your primary residence.\n2. **No Subletting**: You're occupying the apartment as a primary resident, and there's no subletting (renting out) occurring.\n3. **No Rent Increases**: There haven't been any rent increases above 20% in the previous five years.\n\n**Income-Based Deregulation**\n\nNow, about your question: Can your occupied apartment be deregulated based on your rent level and income?\n\nThe answer is no, not directly. The NYC Rent Regulation Board (RRB) doesn't consider individual tenant incomes when determining rent regulation status. However, if you're paying a very high rent relative to the building's average rent or median household income in the area, it might indirectly impact the deregulation process.\n\n**Rent Level Comparison**\n\nWhen applying for deregulation, buildings are compared to similar apartments in the same neighborhood (called \"comparable units\"). If your rent is significantly higher than these comparable units, it may indicate that your apartment isn't being properly regulated. This could lead to an investigation by the RRB or a lawsuit from you, the tenant.\n\n**Income-Based Relief**\n\nWhile income can't directly trigger deregulation, there are instances where income-based relief might apply:\n\n1. **Low-Income Households**: If you're part of a low-income household (typically below 30% of area median income), you may be eligible for rent subsidies or assistance programs.\n2. **Government Assistance**: Some government assistance programs, like Section 8 housing vouchers, can help reduce your rent burden.\n\nTo determine if your apartment is deregulated or not, I recommend:\n\n1. Contact the NYC Rent Regulation Board (RRB) to inquire about your specific situation.\n2. Review your lease agreement and any relevant notices from your landlord.\n3. Consult with a tenant attorney or housing counselor to better understand your rights and options.\n\nRemember that rent regulation laws are constantly evolving, so it's essential to stay informed about changes in the regulations and their impact on your apartment."

            "gpt-5.1": "Yes. Once a unit is lawfully deregulated (for example, if it\u2019s no longer subject to rent stabilization or rent control), it generally becomes a free-market (unregulated) apartment, and the landlord can:\n\n- Charge a market-rate rent; and  \n- Increase the rent by whatever amount they choose at lease renewal (subject to anti-harassment, discrimination, and basic contract law).\n\nHowever, the critical issue in NYC right now is **whether your unit can actually be deregulated at all**, because the law changed sharply in 2019.\n\n### Key points under current NYC/NY State law\n\n1. **High-rent vacancy deregulation and luxury deregulation were abolished in 2019.**  \n   Under the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA), landlords can no longer deregulate apartments simply because:\n   - The legal rent passed a threshold (e.g., $2,774.76+, as it used to be), or  \n   - The tenant\u2019s income was above a certain amount.\n\n2. **Most rent\u2011stabilized units stay rent\u2011stabilized indefinitely.**  \n   Today, a rent\u2011stabilized unit usually *does not* come out of regulation just because the rent has reached a certain number or there is a vacancy. Deregulation is now rare and must be based on specific, narrow circumstances, such as:\n   - The building is legitimately no longer subject to rent stabilization (e.g., a small owner\u2011occupied building with fewer than 6 units that was mistakenly treated as stabilized, or a building that has permanently and lawfully exited a tax\u2011benefit program like 421\u2011a *after* all stabilization obligations end).\n   - The apartment was never actually required to be stabilized in the first place (sometimes discovered in litigation or DHCR proceedings).\n\n3. **If the landlord wrongly claims deregulation, the \u201cmarket\u201d rent is not valid.**  \n   If your unit is still legally rent\u2011stabilized (or should be), the landlord:\n   - **Cannot** lawfully treat it as deregulated;  \n   - **Cannot** charge unlimited \u201cmarket\u201d rent; and  \n   - Must follow Rent Guidelines Board increases and all rent stabilization rules (including registration with DHCR, providing a rent\u2011stabilized lease rider, etc.).\n\n   Overcharges plus penalties can be ordered if a landlord illegally deregulates or illegally inflates rent.\n\n4. **If your unit is truly deregulated, you still have some protections.**  \n   Even in a free\u2011market apartment, the landlord must still:\n   - Honor the existing lease until it expires;  \n   - Provide required notices for rent increases and non\u2011renewal (e.g., 30/60/90 days depending on length of tenancy under HSTPA);  \n   - Comply with the warranty of habitability and anti\u2011retaliation laws;  \n   - Avoid discriminatory conduct (Fair Housing laws).\n\n### What you should check\n\nTo know whether the landlord can properly offer you \u201cmarket rate,\u201d you need to confirm if the deregulation is legitimate:\n\n1. **Get your rent history from DHCR.**  \n   - Call DHCR at (718) 739\u20116400 or request online or in person.  \n   - This will show whether DHCR considers your apartment rent\u2011stabilized and what the registered rents have been.\n\n2. **Check for these red flags:**\n   - Sudden jump from a low stabilized rent to a very high unregulated \u201cmarket\u201d rent in one year.  \n   - No rent\u2011stabilized rider attached to your prior leases even though the building has 6+ units and was built before 1974 or has/ had a tax benefit program.  \n   - Landlord claiming \u201cderegulation\u201d based only on the rent reaching a certain amount after 2019.\n\n3. **Consider getting legal help if there\u2019s any doubt.**  \n   - Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, Legal Assistance corporations, or housing clinics can review your rent history and lease.  \n   - They can tell you if the deregulation claim is probably illegal and whether you have a rent overcharge or re\u2011regulation case.\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **If your unit is truly and lawfully deregulated**, yes, the landlord can offer you a market\u2011rate rent and is not bound by rent stabilization increases.  \n- **If your unit *should* still be regulated** under current NYC/NY State law, the landlord cannot legally deregulate it just to charge market rent, and any \u201cmarket\u201d rent demand could be challengeable.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The building size,  \n- Approximate year built,  \n- Whether there was 421\u2011a/J\u201151 or other tax benefits, and  \n- What your rent history looks like (roughly, year\u2011by\u2011year changes),  \nI can give a more tailored assessment of whether deregulation in your situation is likely valid.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Maybe \u2014 but only if the unit is lawfully deregulated. In most cases today, a rent\u2011stabilized unit cannot be converted to market rate while you are in occupancy, and true deregulation is relatively rare since the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA).\n\nKey points\n- If your unit is lawfully deregulated (that is, it is not a rent\u2011stabilized unit under New York law), the landlord may charge a market rent.  \n- However, HSTPA (2019) eliminated the common routes landlords used to \u201cvacancy\u2011deregulate\u201d units (high\u2011rent/high\u2011income and vacancy decontrol). As a result, most units that are rent\u2011stabilized remain stabilized even when they become vacant.  \n- A landlord cannot unilaterally take a rent\u2011stabilized unit off the rolls and switch you to a market rent while you are still a tenant, unless there has been a lawful change in the unit\u2019s regulatory status (for example, the unit was never subject to stabilization because of the building\u2019s size or construction date, or the unit was lawfully deregulated before current law or under narrow exceptions).  \n- If a landlord tells you the unit is deregulated and demands a market rent, you can demand proof (e.g., the owner\u2019s filing with NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)/DHCR showing the unit is not registered as stabilized).\n\nWhat you should do\n1. Check your unit\u2019s rent history and registration status at New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). That will show whether the unit is listed as rent\u2011stabilized and the legal regulated rent history.  \n2. Ask the landlord in writing to show documentation proving the unit\u2019s deregulation.  \n3. If you believe the unit is still stabilized but the landlord is charging market rent, contact HCR or a tenant attorney/legal aid. You may have a rent overcharge or illegal deregulation claim.  \n4. If the unit truly is deregulated and you are moving out, the landlord can seek market rent for a new tenant.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether your lease says \u201crent\u2011stabilized,\u201d the building size or year built, and whether the landlord gave you a written deregulation notice \u2014 I can help you interpret those facts and suggest next steps.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: yes, but with important caveats.\n\nWhat \u201cderegulated\u201d means\n- In NYC, a rent-stabilized unit can be deregulated if certain conditions are met (typically when the unit becomes vacant and the legal rent is above a statutory threshold, and there are separate rules for high\u2011income deregulation). Once deregulated, the unit is no longer covered by rent stabilization for future tenants.\n\nIf you\u2019re living in the unit and it becomes deregulated\n- The landlord can offer you a new lease at market (non-stabilized) rent when your current lease ends.\n- You are not automatically moved out or forced to accept a market-rate rent immediately; you would typically still stay under your current terms until your lease expires, and then any renewal would be at market rate if the unit is deregulated.\n- If you want to stay after deregulation, you would generally sign a non-stabilized lease at the market rent (unless the landlord chooses not to renew, in which case you\u2019d need to move out when the lease ends).\n\nWhat this means in practice\n- A deregulated unit means future tenants pay market rent; it also means the current tenant\u2019s future renewals, after a lease ends, would be at market rent (not stabilized rent).\n- The landlord cannot automatically force you out solely to push deregulation; deregulation typically occurs at vacancy or under the high-income rules, and eviction procedures still apply for non-renewals or other lawful grounds.\n\nImportant notes and next steps\n- The exact rent and income thresholds for deregulation have changed over time. Check the current rules with the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) or the NYS Division of Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR).\n- If you\u2019re offered a \u201cbuyout\u201d or a move to a non-stabilized unit, consider consulting a tenants\u2019 rights attorney or a local tenant organization before accepting anything.\n- For authoritative, up-to-date guidance, you can contact DHCR, HPD, or call 311 for local housing assistance.\n\nIf you want, tell me your building\u2019s details (year built, number of units, whether you\u2019re in a rent-stabilized unit, etc.) and I can tailor the guidance and point you to the right official resources.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "This is a critical question, and the answer depends heavily on **when** and **how** your unit might deregulate, especially in light of the **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown based on NYC law:\n\n1.  **The Impact of HSTPA (June 14, 2019):**\n    *   The HSTPA **eliminated most pathways for deregulation** for rent-stabilized units.\n    *   **High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation** (where a unit became deregulated if the rent reached a certain threshold and the unit became vacant) was abolished.\n    *   **High-Rent High-Income Deregulation** (where a unit could be deregulated if the rent was high and the tenants' income exceeded a certain threshold) was also abolished.\n    *   This means that for the vast majority of units that were rent-stabilized *before* HSTPA, they **cannot deregulate** under these mechanisms anymore. They remain rent-stabilized indefinitely, regardless of rent level or tenant income.\n\n2.  **Remaining Deregulation Pathways (and what happens then):**\n    While most deregulation was stopped, a few specific scenarios still exist:\n\n    *   **Expiration of Tax Abatements (J-51 or 421-a):**\n        *   Some buildings receive tax abatements (like J-51 for renovations or 421-a for new construction) in exchange for placing units under rent stabilization for a *temporary* period.\n        *   **If your unit's rent stabilization is solely due to one of these abatements, and that abatement period officially expires, then yes, the unit can deregulate.**\n        *   **In this specific scenario, once the unit is legally deregulated, the landlord *can* then offer you a market-rate rent.** You would lose your rent stabilization protections, and future rent increases would not be governed by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n\n    *   **Co-op/Condo Conversion (with specific conditions):**\n        *   If a building converts to a co-op or condo, existing rent-stabilized tenants often retain their stabilization rights. However, new tenants moving into units that become vacant *after* the conversion might not be rent-stabilized. This is more about the unit's status upon vacancy rather than a \"deregulation\" of an occupied unit.\n\n    *   **Owner Occupancy (for buildings with fewer than 6 units):**\n        *   If a building has fewer than six units and the owner moves into one of the units, certain other units in the building *may* become exempt from rent stabilization. This is a specific exemption, not a general deregulation.\n\n3.  **What if your landlord *claims* your unit is deregulated but it shouldn't be?**\n    *   This is a common issue. Landlords sometimes incorrectly claim a unit is deregulated, especially if it was vacant for a period or if they performed renovations.\n    *   **Do NOT assume your unit is deregulated just because your landlord says so.**\n    *   **Always check your unit's rent history** with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR). You can request a rent history for your apartment, which will show if it was ever registered as rent-stabilized and what the legal regulated rent was.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **For the vast majority of previously rent-stabilized units in NYC, deregulation is no longer possible due to HSTPA.** If your unit is still rent-stabilized, your landlord **cannot** offer you a market-rate rent; they must adhere to Rent Guidelines Board increases.\n*   **The primary exception where a unit *can* still deregulate is upon the expiration of a temporary tax abatement (like J-51 or 421-a). If this happens, then yes, your landlord can offer you a market-rate rent.**\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1.  **Request your rent history from DHCR.** This is the most crucial first step to understand your unit's status.\n2.  **If your landlord claims your unit is deregulated, do not sign anything immediately.**\n3.  **Seek legal advice from a housing attorney or tenant advocacy group.** They can review your specific situation, your rent history, and any documents from your landlord to determine if the deregulation claim is legitimate.",
            "llama3": "The joys of rental property law!\n\nIn general, when a unit is deregulated (also known as \"vacancy decontrol\" or \"rent regulation reform\"), the landlord is no longer bound by the previous rent stabilization laws and regulations. This means they can set a new rent that reflects the current market rate.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Deregulation typically applies to units that were previously regulated**: If your unit was previously subject to rent control or rent stabilization, deregulation may allow the landlord to charge a higher rent.\n2. **The landlord must provide notice**: Before increasing the rent, the landlord is required to give you written notice, usually 30 days, explaining the new rent amount and why it's being increased (e.g., due to deregulation).\n3. **Rent increases are not automatic**: Even after deregulation, the landlord still needs to justify a rent increase by providing evidence of market-rate rents in the area.\n4. **The landlord must comply with local laws**: Your landlord must follow local laws and regulations regarding rent increases. For example, some cities have specific procedures for determining fair market rent or caps on rent increases.\n\nTo protect yourself, make sure:\n\n1. Review your lease: Understand what's included in your current lease agreement and how it might be affected by deregulation.\n2. Research the market: Learn about average rents in your area to determine if the landlord's proposed rent increase is reasonable.\n3. Negotiate or seek mediation: If you're unhappy with the proposed rent increase, try negotiating with your landlord or seeking mediation through a local housing agency.\n\nRemember that deregulation rules and regulations vary by state, city, or locality, so it's essential to familiarize yourself with the specific laws governing your rental property.\n\nI hope this information helps!"

Household composition & occupancy\n\n- The people living in the apartment must be an **approved household**:\n  - Everyone must be properly listed on your application and subsequent income affidavits.\n  - Additions (marriage, birth, certain family moves) usually must be reported and approved.\n- **Occupancy standards**:\n  - There are rules connecting household size to apartment size (no intentional overcrowding).\n  - You generally cannot have more people than the development\u2019s approved occupancy standard for your apartment.\n\nUnauthorized occupants or long\u2011term guests can be grounds for termination, so changes in who lives there must be reported.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Primary residence requirement\n\n- You must use the Mitchell\u2011Lama apartment as your **primary residence**.\n- Indicators of primary residence include:\n  - Where you file state and federal taxes\n  - Address on driver\u2019s license/NYC ID\n  - Voter registration, bank accounts, utility bills\n- Long absences, subletting without proper approval, or maintaining another primary residence can be grounds for loss of the apartment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. No other subsidized or regulated housing conflicts\n\n- Typically, you **cannot**:\n  - Hold a Mitchell\u2011Lama unit and another subsidized or regulated apartment as your primary residence.\n  - Own certain types of housing (especially in low\u2011income developments) that would conflict with eligibility.\n- Co\u2011op Mitchell\u2011Lama developments may have specific rules on owning other real estate or co\u2011op shares.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Annual income affidavits and re\u2011certification\n\nTo remain eligible as a tenant:\n\n- You must complete **annual income affidavits** and/or re\u2011certifications:\n  - Disclose income and household composition.\n  - Provide documentation (tax returns, W\u20112s, Social Security statements, etc.).\n- Failure to file or provide documents can lead to surcharges and eventually termination.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Citizenship and immigration status\n\nMitchell\u2011Lama itself is not limited to citizens only, but:\n- All household members must disclose their status on required forms.\n- If your development is also tied to a federal program (e.g., Section 8), additional immigration rules may apply.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Other common requirements\n\nDepending on the development and whether it\u2019s HPD\u2011 or HCR\u2011supervised:\n\n- **Age & family status**: Some developments are designated for seniors, families, or specific populations.\n- **Credit / ability to pay**: Management can consider your ability to pay rent or maintenance.\n- **Co\u2011op\u2013specific**:\n  - Purchase price and financing must meet the program\u2019s rules.\n  - There may be limits on resale price, flip taxes, and rules about succession.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Succession rights (who can keep the apartment)\n\nTo \u201csucceed\u201d to a Mitchell\u2011Lama apartment when the tenant of record leaves/dies, a family member or qualifying occupant normally must:\n\n- Have been in **approved occupancy** (properly listed) and\n- Have **lived there as their primary residence** for the required period (commonly 2 years, 1 year for seniors/disabled) immediately before the tenant\u2019s vacatur or death,\n- Meet income and eligibility criteria at the time they apply for succession.\n\n---\n\n## To get exact requirements for your building\n\nBecause the specifics can differ by development, the best way to know your exact obligations is to:\n\n1. Check who supervises your building:\n   - Ask management if it\u2019s an **HPD** (NYC) or **HCR** (state) Mitchell\u2011Lama.\n2. Request:\n   - The **house rules** or occupancy agreement.\n   - The **current income/eligibility schedule** and surcharge charts.\n3. Look at:\n   - HPD Mitchell\u2011Lama: https://www.nyc.gov/hpd (search \u201cMitchell\u2011Lama\u201d)\n   - NYS HCR Mitchell\u2011Lama: https://hcr.ny.gov (search \u201cMitchell\u2011Lama Housing Program\u201d)\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether your building is HPD or HCR supervised, and  \n- If it\u2019s rental or co\u2011op,  \n\nI can walk through the specific income thresholds, primary residence tests, and succession standards that apply to you.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Mitchell-Lama developments are run under New York State\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program, but specifics can vary by building. Below are the common eligibility rules you should expect, and what to do next.\n\nCommon eligibility requirements\n- Income limits: Each development sets maximum (and sometimes minimum) household income limits for different unit sizes. Limits are based on Area Median Income (AMI) and on household size, and are set for each offering. You must document income for everyone in the household.\n- Household size / unit-size standards: Units are allotted according to household size (for example, a 1\u2011bedroom vs. 3\u2011bedroom). You must meet the development\u2019s occupancy standards for the unit you apply for.\n- Citizenship / immigration status: Applicants generally must be U.S. citizens or have eligible immigration status. Requirements are set by the program and the development.\n- Assets / net-worth limits (especially for co-op purchases): For purchasing a Mitchell-Lama co\u2011op (initial or restricted resales) some developments impose limits on assets and net worth in addition to income limits.\n- Screening (credit/criminal/eviction history): Management will typically screen applicants\u2019 credit, rental history and criminal history. Note that New York City\u2019s Fair Chance Housing law and other fair\u2011housing laws limit how criminal records and certain screening practices may be used; landlords must follow those rules and do individualized assessments rather than blanket exclusions.\n- No outstanding obligations to the development/agency: Applicants who owe money or are in default on a unit in the same development or program may be ineligible.\n- Preferences and set\u2011asides: Some developments give preference to local residents, municipal employees, seniors, veterans, or other categories. Units may be set aside at different income tiers.\n\nDifferences: rental vs. co\u2011op\n- Mitchell\u2011Lama rentals: You apply for a rent\u00ad-stabilized unit and must meet the income/household requirements for the unit offered. There are usually waiting lists or lotteries.\n- Mitchell\u2011Lama co\u2011ops (initial/limited\u2011equity): Purchasers must meet income and net\u2011worth rules and get coop board approval. Resales are often restricted (price caps, buyer eligibility). Each development\u2019s shareholder/coop rules matter.\n\nOther legal protections and points\n- Fair Housing: Federal, State and NYC fair\u2011housing laws apply (including NYC Human Rights Law). Discrimination on protected bases (race, religion, national origin, disability, family status, lawful source of income in NYC, etc.) is illegal.\n- Reasonable accommodations: Applicants with disabilities can request reasonable accommodations in application/screening.\n- Conversion / privatization: Some Mitchell\u2011Lama developments have converted out of the program. If your building is no longer in Mitchell\u2011Lama, different rules may apply.\n\nWhat to do next\n1. Contact your building\u2019s managing agent or superintendent and ask for the development\u2019s current admissions/occupancy policy and the application packet for the specific building/unit type.\n2. Check New York State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR) for Mitchell\u2011Lama program information and any posted offering plans, and NYC HPD if your building interacts with city programs.\n   - HCR: hcr.ny.gov (search \u201cMitchell\u2011Lama\u201d)\n   - NYC HPD: nyc.gov/hpd\n3. If you\u2019re denied or need help understanding eligibility or a board decision, you can seek help from NYC\u2019s NYC Housing Preservation & Development (for some matters), or legal services/tenant advocacy groups (Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, neighborhood housing groups).\n\nIf you want, tell me: which Mitchell\u2011Lama development you live in (name or address) and whether you mean rental or co\u2011op, and I can look up the specific eligibility rules or point you to the building\u2019s application and the exact income limits that apply.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Mitchell-Lama rentals are subject to both state program rules and the specific rules set by the building\u2019s sponsor. Because each development can have its own details, the exact eligibility criteria can vary. In general, tenants must meet the following common requirements:\n\n- Income limits: Your household income must be within the program\u2019s limits for the unit, based on household size. For many Mitchell-Lama rentals, the limit is tied to a percentage of the area median income (AMI), often around 80% AMI, but some buildings use different levels. The limits are published annually by New York State Homes & Community Renewal (HCR) and are specific to each unit.\n\n- Primary residence: You must intend to live in the unit as your primary residence. Subletting or using the unit as an investment is not allowed without approval.\n\n- Occupancy limits: There are limits on how many people may live in a unit, based on the unit size and the building\u2019s occupancy standards.\n\n- Asset limits (in some buildings): Some Mitchell-Lama developments impose asset or net worth limits in addition to income limits. If applicable, you\u2019d need to disclose assets (bank accounts, investments, etc.) and stay under the allowed threshold.\n\n- Background and rental history: Landlords typically screen applicants. They may check prior eviction history, credit history, and references from previous landlords or employers.\n\n- Verification and documentation: Expect to provide income documentation (pay stubs, tax returns, W-2s), identification, and other information for all adults living in the unit. You\u2019ll also be asked to certify that the information you provide is accurate.\n\n- Annual/periodic recertification: Many Mitchell-Lama buildings require annual income re-certification to continue renting the unit. If income rises and exceeds the limit, it can affect your eligibility or future rent.\n\n- Subletting and transfers: Subletting is generally restricted, and moves or transfers typically require sponsor approval and adherence to the program\u2019s rules.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Check with your building management or the sponsor for the exact eligibility criteria for your specific unit. They can provide the current income limits, size-based limits, any asset rules, and the required documentation.\n- You can also contact NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) or the local housing resource listed by your building for the official, up-to-date guidelines.\n- If you want, tell me your building\u2019s name and unit type, and I can help you locate the current eligibility criteria or point you to the right contact.\n\nNote: Because Mitchell-Lama rules can differ by development and can change, the best source for your exact requirements is your building\u2019s management/sponsor and NYS HCR.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "As a housing law assistant, I can tell you that Mitchell-Lama developments in NYC are designed to provide affordable housing, and as such, they have specific eligibility requirements for tenants. These requirements are primarily set by the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) for city-supervised developments, or NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) for state-supervised ones.\n\nHere are the main eligibility requirements tenants typically have to meet:\n\n1.  **Income Limits (Minimum and Maximum):**\n    *   **Maximum Income:** This is the most critical requirement. Your household's total annual income must not exceed a certain percentage of the Area Median Income (AMI) for your household size. These limits vary significantly by development, apartment size, and are updated annually. They are designed to ensure that the housing remains affordable for those who need it.\n    *   **Minimum Income:** Most developments also have a minimum income requirement to ensure that tenants can afford the monthly carrying charges (for co-ops) or rent (for rentals) without undue hardship. This is often calculated as a multiple of the monthly housing cost (e.g., 2-3 times the rent/maintenance).\n    *   **Source:** These limits are set by HPD or HCR and are specific to each development.\n\n2.  **Household Composition and Size:**\n    *   There are rules about the number of occupants per apartment to prevent both overcrowding and under-utilization. For example:\n        *   A studio apartment might be for 1-2 people.\n        *   A one-bedroom might be for 1-2 people.\n        *   A two-bedroom might be for 2-4 people.\n    *   These rules ensure that apartments are allocated appropriately based on family size.\n\n3.  **Primary Residence:**\n    *   The Mitchell-Lama apartment must be your primary residence. You cannot own another residential property (house, condo, co-op) or use the Mitchell-Lama unit as a secondary home or investment property.\n    *   There are very limited exceptions, such as owning an uninhabitable property that is actively being sold, but these are rare and require specific approval from the supervising agency.\n\n4.  **Citizenship/Immigration Status:**\n    *   Generally, applicants must be U.S. citizens or have eligible immigration status.\n\n5.  **Application Process and Waiting Lists:**\n    *   To become a tenant, you must apply when a development's waiting list is open. Due to high demand, many Mitchell-Lama waiting lists are closed and only open periodically, often through a lottery system.\n    *   Applicants are typically screened for creditworthiness, rental history, and criminal background.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Development-Specific Rules:** It is crucial to understand that while these are general guidelines, each Mitchell-Lama development may have its own specific income limits, occupancy standards, and application procedures. You must consult the specific development's management office or the supervising agency (HPD or HCR) for the exact requirements.\n*   **Co-op vs. Rental:** Mitchell-Lama includes both rental buildings and co-operative buildings. While the initial eligibility requirements are similar, co-ops involve purchasing shares and becoming a shareholder, whereas rentals involve signing a lease.\n*   **Succession Rights:** These requirements apply to *initial* applicants. There are separate rules regarding \"succession rights\" which allow eligible family members to take over an apartment after a tenant of record vacates or passes away, provided they meet specific criteria (e.g., living in the apartment with the tenant for a certain period, meeting income limits).\n\nAlways consult the specific Mitchell-Lama development's management or HPD/HCR directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding eligibility.",
            "llama3": "Mitchell-Lama developments are a type of affordable housing program in New York State. To be eligible for tenancy in a Mitchell-Lama development, you must meet certain income and family size requirements. Here are the general guidelines:\n\n1. **Income limits**: Your household income must not exceed 3 times the average median income (AMI) for your area. In NYC, the AMI is around $120,000.\n2. **Family size**: The number of people in your household must be equal to or less than the maximum family size allowed by the program. For example, a studio apartment might have a maximum family size of 1-2 people, while a three-bedroom apartment might have a maximum family size of 6-8 people.\n3. **Residency**: You must be a resident of New York State (or in some cases, only New York City) for at least one year prior to applying for tenancy in the Mitchell-Lama development.\n\nAdditionally, you may need to meet other requirements, such as:\n\n* Being a first-time homebuyer or having a limited income\n* Meeting certain credit score and debt-to-income ratio thresholds\n* Not being able to afford market-rate housing without financial assistance\n\nKeep in mind that these eligibility requirements can vary depending on the specific Mitchell-Lama development you're applying to. It's best to check with the management office or governing body of your development for their specific rules and guidelines.\n\nAs a tenant, you'll also need to comply with any lease agreement, rent payment terms, and other rules outlined in your rental contract."

            "gpt-5.1": "Usually, no. In NYC public housing (NYCHA), tenants are generally entitled to a grievance (hearing) **before** eviction\u2014but there are important exceptions.\n\n### General rule: Right to a grievance hearing first\nFor most issues\u2014like alleged lease violations, chronic rent lateness, or disputes over charges\u2014NYCHA must:\n1. Serve you with written notice of the grounds (e.g., \u201cTermination of Tenancy\u201d or similar), and  \n2. Give you an opportunity to request a grievance hearing, and  \n3. Hold that hearing and issue a decision  \n**before** bringing you to Housing Court for eviction.\n\nIf NYCHA skips this and goes straight to court in a situation where a grievance was required, you (or your lawyer) can raise that as a defense.\n\n### Main exceptions: When NYCHA can skip the grievance\nNYCHA can bypass the grievance process **only in specific, limited situations**, which are treated as \u201cnon-grievable\u201d or \u201cadministratively excluded\u201d cases, typically involving:\n\n- **Serious criminal activity** on or near the development\n- **Violent or drug-related criminal activity**\n- Situations where NYCHA claims that a grievance is not required because:\n  - The issue involves a matter already decided in court\n  - The issue is covered by federal \u201cone-strike\u201d or similar rules\n  - The tenant is an unauthorized occupant and NYCHA is not recognizing them as a tenant\n\nIn those cases, NYCHA may:\n- Serve a termination notice that says the case is **\u201cnot subject to the grievance procedure\u201d** or similar language, and  \n- Go directly to Housing Court without giving you a NYCHA hearing.\n\nWhether NYCHA is correct in labeling a case \u201cnon-grievable\u201d can itself be disputed in Housing Court. Courts sometimes find NYCHA was wrong and should have given a grievance.\n\n### How to protect yourself\n1. **Read every notice carefully.**  \n   Look for:\n   - \u201cYou have a right to a grievance hearing\u201d \u2192 then you can (and usually should) request one by the stated deadline.  \n   - \u201cThis determination is not subject to the grievance procedure\u201d or similar \u2192 NYCHA is claiming it can skip the hearing.\n\n2. **If you\u2019re already in Housing Court:**  \n   - Tell the judge if you were never offered a grievance in a case that should have been grievable.  \n   - Ask for a referral to the **Right to Counsel** program (if you\u2019re income-eligible) or a tenant attorney.\n\n3. **Get legal help quickly.**  \n   Contact:\n   - Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, Bronx/Queens/Brooklyn/Manhattan Legal Services\n   - Mobilization for Justice\n   - Local bar association referral line  \n   Many provide free help to NYCHA tenants.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- What kind of notice you received (exact title/heading),  \n- What NYCHA is accusing you of, and  \n- Whether the notice mentions the grievance procedure,  \n\nI can tell you more specifically whether NYCHA likely must give you a grievance before trying to evict you.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Generally no \u2014 NYCHA (and other public housing authorities) must follow required procedures and you have a right to challenge most proposed evictions through the housing authority\u2019s grievance/hearing process and then in court. They cannot physically remove you without going through legal eviction (a court proceeding). There are a few narrow exceptions (see below), so act quickly.\n\nWhat you should know\n- Federal HUD rules require public housing authorities to have grievance/hearing procedures for tenants, and NYCHA has its own grievance process. That means you normally get notice of lease termination and the chance to request a hearing to contest the reasons for eviction or termination of tenancy.  \n- Eviction requires a court proceeding (a holdover or unlawful eviction case) and a court order. NYCHA cannot change the locks or forcibly remove you without a marshal/constable executing a court order.  \n- Exceptions: there are limited exceptions where the administrative grievance procedure does not apply (for example, certain urgent criminal-activity or safety situations or other narrow statutory/regulatory exceptions). Also some forms of termination may proceed quickly if safety is at immediate risk. Even if a grievance is not available, you still have defenses in Housing Court and the right to an attorney if you qualify.\n\nWhat to do now\n1. Read any notice you received carefully \u2014 it usually tells you whether you have a right to request a grievance/hearing and gives a deadline. Request the grievance/hearing in writing immediately and keep a copy (email, certified mail, or hand-delivered with a dated receipt).  \n2. Save all documents and evidence (notices, repair requests, medical records, witness names). Attend the grievance hearing and any court dates.  \n3. Get legal help right away. In NYC many low-income tenants facing eviction are entitled to free counsel in Housing Court (Right to Counsel program). Call 311 for referrals, or contact Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, or The New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG). You can also contact NYCHA\u2019s Grievance Office (phone/address shown on NYCHA notices or NYCHA\u2019s website).  \n4. If NYCHA tries to lock you out or physically remove you without a court order, call 311 and the police and get legal help immediately \u2014 that is an illegal eviction.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- what exact notice you received (copy of wording or date), and\n- whether NYCHA said you have a right to a grievance hearing,\nand I can help draft a grievance/hearing request and point you to local legal help.",
            "gpt-5-nano": "Short answer: Not necessarily. In NYC public housing (like NYCHA), eviction can proceed through the court system even if you file a grievance. The internal Grievance Procedure is an internal way to challenge NYCHA\u2019s decisions about your tenancy or services, but it does not automatically stop an eviction case in housing court.\n\nWhat this means in practice:\n- NYCHA can file for eviction in housing court after giving the required notices. You\u2019ll get a court date and have a chance to defend yourself there.\n- You have the right to use NYCHA\u2019s Grievance Procedure to challenge the underlying issue (for example, a lease violation or rent calculation). The grievance process is separate from the court eviction process and does not automatically pause or cancel the eviction filing.\n- You also have the right to legal representation in housing court (Right to Counsel NYC) if you meet the income/eligibility requirements. A lawyer can help you defend the eviction in court and can advise on using the grievance process effectively.\n\nWhat you should do if you\u2019re facing eviction:\n- Do not ignore any notices. Respond in time and appear at any court dates.\n- Consider getting legal help as soon as possible (Legal Aid, NYC Legal Services, or a private attorney). If you qualify, you may have free representation in housing court.\n- File a grievance with NYCHA if you believe the underlying reason for eviction is mistaken or improperly applied. This is separate from the eviction case and has its own procedures and timelines\u2014ask NYCHA for the exact steps and deadlines or check your lease for the grievance guidelines.\n- Gather all relevant documents: your lease, notices you received, proof of income, rent payments, communications with NYCHA, any witnesses.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Are you in NYC (NYCHA) or another public housing agency?\n- Are you already in housing court, or is there only a notice so far?\n- Do you want help locating the NYC Right to Counsel or a nearby legal aid office?\n\nI can tailor steps and point you to specific resources in your area.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "No, **generally, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) cannot evict you from public housing without first giving you a chance to grieve the termination of your tenancy.**\n\nThis right to a grievance hearing is a fundamental due process protection for public housing tenants, mandated by federal HUD regulations and NYCHA's own policies.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **The General Rule: Right to a Grievance Hearing**\n    *   For most reasons that NYCHA might want to terminate your tenancy (e.g., lease violations like unauthorized occupants, noise complaints, minor damage, non-payment of rent), they must first send you a **Notice of Termination of Tenancy**.\n    *   This notice must inform you of your right to request an **administrative grievance hearing** within a specific timeframe (usually 10-15 days).\n    *   If you request a grievance hearing, NYCHA cannot proceed with an eviction case in Housing Court until that grievance process is completed and a decision is rendered.\n    *   The grievance process typically involves an informal conference and, if unresolved, a formal hearing before an impartial hearing officer. This is your opportunity to present your side of the story, offer evidence, and challenge NYCHA's claims.\n\n2.  **Exceptions: When NYCHA Can Go Directly to Court**\n    There are specific, serious circumstances where NYCHA is permitted to bypass the administrative grievance procedure and go directly to Housing Court to seek an eviction. These exceptions are primarily related to criminal activity or immediate threats:\n    *   **Drug-related criminal activity** on or near the premises.\n    *   **Violent criminal activity** on or near the premises.\n    *   Any criminal activity that **threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment** of the premises by other residents or NYCHA employees.\n    *   **Threats to the health or safety** of NYCHA employees or other residents.\n\n    Even in these exceptional cases, you still have due process rights in Housing Court. NYCHA must still prove their case in court, and you will have the opportunity to defend yourself before a judge.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nFor most lease violations, NYCHA **must** offer you a chance to grieve the termination of your tenancy before they can take you to court for eviction. If they try to evict you for a reason that is not one of the severe exceptions listed above without offering a grievance, they are likely violating your rights.\n\n**What you should do if you receive a Notice of Termination:**\n\n*   **Do NOT ignore it.**\n*   **Immediately request a grievance hearing** if the notice offers one. Follow the instructions precisely.\n*   **Gather all relevant documents and evidence** to support your case.\n*   **Seek legal assistance immediately.** An attorney specializing in public housing law can help you understand your rights, represent you in the grievance process, and defend you in Housing Court if necessary.\n\n**Where to find legal help in NYC:**\n\n*   **Legal Aid Society**\n*   **Legal Services NYC**\n*   **New York City Bar Association Legal Referral Service**\n*   **Housing Court Answers**\n\nKnowing your rights and acting quickly are crucial when facing a potential eviction from public housing.",
            "llama3": "In general, if you're living in public housing and are facing eviction, you have certain rights that protect you from being evicted without due process. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. **Notice of Eviction**: Your housing authority must provide you with written notice before terminating your tenancy. This notice should state the reasons for the termination, as well as any procedural steps you can take to address the issues.\n2. **Grievance Procedure**: Public housing authorities are required to have a grievance procedure in place, which allows you to challenge the eviction decision. This process typically involves filing a grievance with the authority, followed by an investigation and a hearing (if necessary).\n3. **Due Process**: The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations require public housing authorities to provide residents with due process before terminating their tenancy. This means that you have the right to:\n\na. Receive written notice of the termination.\n\nb. Be given an opportunity to present evidence or arguments in support of your continued tenancy.\n\nc. Have a hearing or other opportunity to address any issues leading to the proposed termination, if requested.\n\n4. **Eviction Timeline**: The timeline for eviction varies depending on the circumstances and local regulations. Generally, you may have 30-60 days from receipt of notice to file a grievance and request a hearing.\n5. **Assistance and Support**: If you're facing eviction, it's essential to seek assistance from the housing authority's resident services department or a non-profit organization that provides tenant advocacy.\n\nTo protect your rights:\n\n1. Read your lease agreement carefully, as it may outline specific procedures for termination of tenancy.\n\n2. Keep records of any communications with the housing authority regarding potential issues or concerns.\n\n3. Seek legal advice if you're unsure about the eviction process or need guidance on filing a grievance.\n\n4. Familiarize yourself with local regulations and HUD guidelines, which can be found on the HUD website.\n\nRemember that each situation is unique, and it's crucial to understand your specific rights and obligations as a public housing resident. If you're facing eviction, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance."

        "ground_truth": "Under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program, families receive a rental subsidy equal to the difference between their share of the rent (based on their income) and the approved rent for the unit. Eligible families and individuals are subject to statutory income limits.",

            "gpt-5.1": "Section 8 (Housing Choice Voucher Program) in NYC follows a formula set by HUD, with some local NYC tweaks. The amount of rent that gets subsidized is based on:\n\n1. **Your household income**\n2. **The payment standard** for your voucher size (set by NYCHA/HPD)\n3. **The actual contract rent** for the apartment (rent + any tenant-paid utilities)\n4. **Your required tenant share** (usually 30% of your adjusted monthly income)\n\nHere\u2019s how it works step by step:\n\n---\n\n### 1. They calculate your \u201cadjusted monthly income\u201d\n\nStart with your **gross annual household income**, then subtract certain allowed deductions (for example, some disability, elderly, or dependent deductions if applicable).  \n\nThen they convert that to **monthly adjusted income**:\n> Adjusted Monthly Income = Adjusted Annual Income \u00f7 12\n\n---\n\n### 2. They determine your basic tenant share (usually 30%)\n\nUnder federal rules, you normally pay about:\n> **30% of your adjusted monthly income**  \n(or a minimum rent if applicable, but this is less common)\n\nExample:  \nIf your adjusted monthly income is $1,500, your basic tenant share is:\n> 30% \u00d7 $1,500 = $450 per month\n\nThat $450 is the baseline of what you\u2019re expected to pay toward rent and utilities.\n\n---\n\n### 3. They look at the payment standard vs. the apartment\u2019s gross rent\n\nTwo key terms:\n\n- **Payment standard**: The maximum amount the voucher is designed to cover for your voucher size and neighborhood (based on HUD fair market rents, adjusted locally). This is *not* a cap on what the landlord can charge, but it is a cap on how much the voucher is designed to subsidize.\n- **Gross rent**: The **contract rent + any tenant-paid utilities** (using a standard utility allowance chart).\n\nThe subsidy is usually:\n> Payment Standard \u2212 Your Tenant Share (30% of adjusted income)\n\nBut if the **gross rent is below the payment standard**, they use the **gross rent** instead of the payment standard to calculate the subsidy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Your initial rent share cannot usually exceed 40% of your income\n\nWhen you first move in with a voucher:\n\n- The program checks that your **tenant share (what you pay)** is **not more than 40% of your adjusted monthly income**.\n- If the apartment is too expensive, your share would go above 40%, and Section 8 will not approve it.\n\nSo, at move-in:\n> Your Rent Share \u2264 40% of adjusted monthly income\n\nAfter the first year, your share can go above 40% if rent increases and you stay, but the initial lease has that limit.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Putting it together with a simple example\n\nAssume:\n- Adjusted monthly income: $1,500  \n- 30% of adjusted income: $450  \n- Payment standard for your voucher: $2,000  \n- Gross rent (rent + utilities): $2,100  \n\nStep 1: Calculate the \u201cbase\u201d subsidy using the **payment standard**:  \nVoucher subsidy (max) = $2,000 \u2212 $450 = $1,550\n\nBut actual **gross rent is $2,100**, which is higher than the payment standard. Section 8 can\u2019t cover beyond the payment standard, so:\n\n- Voucher pays: **$1,550**\n- You pay: **$2,100 \u2212 $1,550 = $550**\n\nNow check the 40% rule at move-in:  \n40% of income = 0.40 \u00d7 $1,500 = $600.  \nYou\u2019d pay $550, which is under $600, so this unit can be approved.\n\n---\n\n### 6. What can change your subsidy amount?\n\nYour share and the subsidy can change if:\n- Your income goes up or down\n- The payment standard changes\n- The landlord raises or lowers the rent (and NYCHA/HPD approves it)\n- The utility allowance changes\n- Your household size or voucher size changes\n\n---\n\n### NYC-specific note\n\nIn NYC, Section 8 is usually administered by:\n- **NYCHA** (New York City Housing Authority), or  \n- **HPD** (NYC Dept. of Housing Preservation & Development), or  \n- Another local agency or nonprofit.\n\nEach uses HUD rules but may set **different payment standards by borough/ZIP code and unit size**. That\u2019s why your friend with the same income but in a different neighborhood might get a different subsidy.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Which agency your voucher is from (NYCHA, HPD, etc.)\n- Your **household size**, **approximate income**, and **rent + utilities**\n\nI can walk through your specific numbers so you can see exactly how much Section 8 should be paying and how much you should expect to pay.",

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "As a Housing Law Assistant, I can explain how Section 8 (Housing Choice Voucher program) determines the amount of rent subsidy in NYC, primarily administered by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).\n\nThe core principle is that **the tenant pays a portion of their income towards rent, and the Section 8 subsidy covers the difference, up to a certain limit.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key factors and the calculation process:\n\n### 1. Tenant's Share of Rent (Tenant Contribution)\n\nThe most significant factor is the household's income. Generally, a Section 8 participant is expected to pay **the highest of the following**:\n\n*   **30% of the household's monthly adjusted gross income.** This is the most common calculation.\n*   **10% of the household's monthly gross income.**\n*   **A minimum rent of $50.**\n\n**How \"Adjusted Gross Income\" is Calculated:**\nNYCHA calculates your adjusted gross income by taking your total gross income (from all sources for all household members) and subtracting certain allowable deductions. These deductions can include:\n*   $480 for each dependent (child, elderly, or disabled person, excluding the head of household or spouse).\n*   $400 for any elderly family (head or spouse is 62 or older) or disabled family.\n*   Medical expense deductions for elderly or disabled families (amounts exceeding 3% of annual income).\n*   Childcare expenses necessary for employment or education.\n\n### 2. The Payment Standard (Subsidy Limit)\n\nThe Section 8 program doesn't just pay \"the rest\" of the rent. There's a maximum amount the subsidy can be, known as the **Payment Standard**.\n\n*   **What it is:** The Payment Standard is the maximum amount of subsidy NYCHA can pay for a particular voucher size (e.g., 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom). It's based on the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for the area, as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and adjusted by NYCHA.\n*   **Factors:** The Payment Standard varies based on:\n    *   **Voucher Size:** The number of bedrooms the household is approved for (e.g., a family approved for a 2-bedroom voucher will have a higher Payment Standard than one approved for a 1-bedroom).\n    *   **Market Conditions:** It reflects the general rental costs in the NYC metropolitan area.\n*   **Utility Allowance:** The Payment Standard also takes into account a \"utility allowance.\" If the tenant is responsible for paying utilities (like heat, hot water, electricity), NYCHA subtracts an estimated utility cost from the Payment Standard to determine the maximum rent portion the landlord can receive.\n\n### 3. The Subsidy Calculation\n\nHere's how it generally works:\n\n1.  **Determine the Tenant's Contribution:** Calculate 30% of the household's adjusted monthly income (or 10% of gross, or $50, whichever is highest).\n2.  **Determine the Maximum Subsidy (Payment Standard):** Find the Payment Standard for the household's voucher size.\n3.  **Determine the Actual Rent:** This is the rent charged by the landlord for the chosen unit.\n4.  **Rent Reasonableness:** NYCHA must determine that the actual rent for the unit is \"reasonable\" compared to similar unassisted units in the area. If it's not, the landlord may need to lower the rent, or the unit won't be approved.\n\n**The Subsidy Amount is generally the difference between the Payment Standard (minus utility allowance if applicable) and the tenant's contribution.**\n\n**Example:**\n\n*   **Tenant's Adjusted Monthly Income:** $2,000\n*   **Tenant's Contribution (30%):** $600\n*   **Payment Standard for a 1-bedroom voucher (hypothetical):** $2,200\n*   **Utility Allowance (if tenant pays utilities):** $150\n*   **Maximum Rent Portion for Landlord (Payment Standard - Utility Allowance):** $2,200 - $150 = $2,050\n\n**Scenario A: Actual Rent is within the Payment Standard**\n*   **Actual Rent for a 1-bedroom apartment:** $1,900 (landlord pays all utilities)\n*   **Tenant's Contribution:** $600\n*   **Section 8 Subsidy:** $1,900 (Actual Rent) - $600 (Tenant's Contribution) = **$1,300**\n\n**Scenario B: Actual Rent is above the Payment Standard**\n*   **Actual Rent for a 1-bedroom apartment:** $2,300 (landlord pays all utilities)\n*   **Payment Standard:** $2,200\n*   **Tenant's Contribution:** $600\n*   **Tenant's Out-of-Pocket:** The tenant would pay their $600 contribution PLUS the amount the actual rent exceeds the Payment Standard ($2,300 - $2,200 = $100).\n*   **Total Tenant Payment:** $600 + $100 = $700\n*   **Section 8 Subsidy:** $2,200 (Payment Standard) - $600 (Tenant's Contribution) = **$1,600**\n    *   *Important Note:* For the *initial* lease, a tenant cannot pay more than 40% of their adjusted monthly income towards rent and utilities combined. If the $700 in this example exceeded 40% of their $2,000 adjusted income ($800), the unit would not be approved unless the rent was lowered.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n\n*   **Income is paramount:** Your income directly determines your share of the rent.\n*   **Payment Standard is the cap:** The subsidy will not exceed the Payment Standard for your voucher size.\n*   **You can pay more:** You *can* choose an apartment with a rent higher than the Payment Standard, but you will be responsible for paying the difference *in addition* to your income-based contribution (subject to the initial 40% rule).\n*   **Report changes:** It is crucial to report any changes in income or household composition to NYCHA promptly, as this will directly affect your rent share and the subsidy amount.\n*   **Annual Recertification:** Your income and household composition are reviewed annually, and your rent share and subsidy are adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis system ensures that the subsidy is tailored to each household's financial situation and the local rental market, helping to make housing affordable.",
            "llama3": "Section 8, also known as the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, is a federal housing assistance program that helps low-income families pay for private market rentals. The program uses a formula to determine how much of your rent will be subsidized.\n\nHere's an overview of how Section 8 decides how much of your rent gets subsidized:\n\n1. **Income calculation**: Your income is calculated based on the gross income (before taxes) from all sources, including wages, tips, commissions, self-employment income, and any other form of income.\n2. **Furniture Allowance**: You may be eligible for a furniture allowance, which is an additional amount to help cover the cost of purchasing furniture and appliances for your new rental unit.\n3. **Rent calculation**: The maximum monthly rent that you are allowed to pay is calculated using the following formula:\n\na. 30% of your adjusted income (income minus deductions)\n\nb. Adjusted gross income (AGI) plus any additional income (if applicable)\n4. **Maximum Allowable Rent (MAR)**: The MAR is the highest possible rent that Section 8 will allow you to pay, which is 30% of your adjusted income.\n5. **Actual Rent**: Your actual rent is the amount that you agree to pay for the rental unit, which must be less than or equal to the MAR.\n6. **Subsidy calculation**: The subsidy amount is the difference between the actual rent and the MAR.\n\nExample:\n\nLet's say your adjusted income is $1,500 per month, and your actual rent is $1,200 per month. The MAR would be $450 (30% of $1,500). In this case, the subsidy would be $350 ($1,200 - $450).\n\nKeep in mind that Section 8 has specific guidelines and limits on the amount of subsidy you can receive, and your local Public Housing Agency (PHA) may have additional requirements or restrictions."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "No, your landlord generally **cannot unilaterally change the terms of your lease whenever they want during the lease period** in NYC.\n\nHere's why, based on NYC housing law:\n\n1.  **A Lease is a Binding Contract:** Your lease is a legally binding contract between you and your landlord. Both parties agree to the terms and conditions for a specific period (the lease term). Once signed, neither party can change those terms without the **mutual consent** of the other party.\n\n2.  **Mutual Agreement Required for Changes:** Any changes to an existing lease must typically be:\n    *   **Agreed upon by both you and your landlord.**\n    *   **Put in writing** (often as a lease addendum or amendment).\n    *   **Signed by both parties.**\n\n3.  **What About Lease Renewals?**\n    *   When your current lease term is *ending*, your landlord can propose new terms for a *renewal lease*. You then have the option to accept those new terms or move out.\n    *   **Important for Rent-Stabilized Apartments:** If your apartment is rent-stabilized, there are very specific rules about how much the rent can be increased and what terms can be changed at renewal. The landlord must offer a renewal lease on the same terms and conditions as the expiring lease, except for the rent increase permitted by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n\n4.  **What if Your Landlord Insists?**\n    *   If your landlord tries to force you to agree to new terms during your current lease, you are generally not obligated to do so.\n    *   Do not sign anything you don't agree with or understand.\n    *   If they try to pressure you or threaten you for not agreeing to changes, this could be considered harassment.\n\n**In summary:** During the active term of your lease, your landlord is bound by the terms you both agreed to. They cannot simply decide to change the rules mid-lease. Any changes require your agreement and should be documented in writing.\n\nIf your landlord is attempting to change terms and you are unsure of your rights, especially if you live in a rent-stabilized apartment, it's advisable to consult with a tenant attorney or a tenant advocacy organization in NYC.",
            "llama3": "A common concern for renters! In most cases, a landlord cannot unilaterally (without your consent) modify lease terms that have already been agreed upon. Here's why:\n\n1. **Lease is a contract**: A lease is a legally binding agreement between you and your landlord. As such, it has contractual obligations on both sides.\n2. **Specific terms are established**: When you signed the lease, specific terms were established, including rent, duration of the tenancy, and responsibilities.\n3. **Modifications require mutual consent**: Generally, if your landlord wants to change any aspect of the lease, they need to obtain your written consent to do so.\n\nHowever, there might be some exceptions or caveats:\n\n1. **Ordinary maintenance or repairs**: Your landlord may have a legitimate reason to make changes that don't affect the fundamental terms of the lease, such as performing routine maintenance or making minor repairs.\n2. **Urgent circumstances**: In extraordinary situations, like an emergency repair or health and safety concern, your landlord might need to take immediate action without your consent. However, they should still notify you as soon as possible and provide a reasonable explanation.\n3. **Termination of the lease**: If the lease is nearing its end date, your landlord may have more flexibility to negotiate new terms for an extended period or a new lease.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\n1. **Carefully review the lease**: Understand what's written in your lease agreement before signing.\n2. **Document any changes**: Keep records of any modifications made to the lease or any agreements you've reached with your landlord.\n3. **Communicate openly**: If your landlord proposes a change, ask questions and seek clarification on the implications for you as a tenant.\n\nRemember that local laws and regulations may vary, so it's essential to familiarize yourself with your state's specific rental laws and consult with a lawyer if needed.\n\nIn summary, while your landlord can't unilaterally modify lease terms without your consent, there might be circumstances where they need to make changes. As a tenant, it's crucial to understand the terms of your lease and communicate openly with your landlord to ensure your rights are protected."

Instead, it will likely be treated as a **month-to-month tenancy**.\n\n2.  **Month-to-Month Tenancy:** This is the most common outcome for oral leases, especially if the duration isn't explicitly agreed upon or if it exceeds one year.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Either the landlord or the tenant can terminate the tenancy by providing proper written notice.\n    *   **Rent Increases:** The landlord can also increase the rent by providing proper written notice.\n\n3.  **Notice Requirements (Crucial for NYC):**\n    *   **To Terminate or Raise Rent (Landlord):** For non-rent-stabilized apartments, the landlord must provide written notice to the tenant to terminate the tenancy or raise the rent. The required notice period depends on how long the tenant has lived in the apartment:\n        *   **Less than 1 year:** 30 days' notice\n        *   **1 year to less than 2 years:** 60 days' notice\n        *   **2 years or more:** 90 days' notice\n    *   **To Vacate (Tenant):** Generally, a tenant on a month-to-month lease must give at least one month's notice before vacating.\n\n4.  **Disadvantages of Oral Leases:**\n    *   **Difficulty of Proof:** The biggest problem is proving the terms of the agreement. If there's a dispute about the rent amount, who is responsible for repairs, pet policies, or the duration of the tenancy, it becomes a \"he said, she said\" situation.\n    *   **Uncertainty:** Without a written document, there's less clarity and more potential for misunderstandings.\n    *   **Vulnerability:** You have fewer protections than with a written lease that clearly outlines rights and responsibilities.\n\n**In summary:** While an oral lease for a non-rent-stabilized apartment is legally permissible in NYC, especially if it's for a year or less, it's **highly unrecommended** due to the lack of clear terms and the difficulty of proving them in a dispute. It's always in both parties' best interest to have a written lease agreement.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, oral leases are generally not permitted for residential rental properties, including apartments that are not rent-stabilized.\n\nAccording to Section 2521 of the New York City Administrative Code, \"All agreements for the use and occupancy of any dwelling unit shall be in writing and signed by all parties.\" This means that written leases or rental agreements must be used for most types of residential rentals, including those that are not rent-stabilized.\n\nHowever, there are a few exceptions:\n\n1. Room and board: Oral agreements may be allowed for room and board arrangements, as long as they are limited to providing meals and accommodations in a private home or apartment.\n2. Month-to-month tenancies: Some landlords and tenants may agree to month-to-month oral leases, but these must comply with specific notice requirements under New York City law.\n\nIf you have an oral lease for your apartment that is not rent-stabilized, it's possible that the agreement may be considered invalid or unenforceable. This could lead to legal issues if there are disputes about the terms of the agreement or if the tenant decides to vacate the premises without providing proper notice.\n\nTo avoid potential problems and ensure that you have a valid and enforceable lease, consider having your landlord prepare a written rental agreement that meets all relevant New York City laws. This can help protect both parties' interests and provide clarity on the terms of the rental arrangement.\n\nKeep in mind that even if an oral lease is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it may still be possible to negotiate a new written lease with your landlord. If you're unsure about the status of your lease or have questions about New York City's rental laws, consider consulting with an attorney or a tenant advocacy organization for guidance."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "No, generally, a verbal agreement for a 2-year lease in New York City (and New York State) is **not enforceable in court** by either party.\n\nHere's why, based on NYC/NY law:\n\n1.  **Statute of Frauds:** New York's Statute of Frauds (General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-701 and \u00a7 5-703) requires that certain agreements be in writing and signed by the party to be charged to be enforceable. This specifically includes:\n    *   Agreements that, by their terms, cannot be performed within one year from the making thereof. A 2-year lease clearly falls into this category.\n    *   Contracts for the leasing of real property for a longer period than one year.\n\n    Since your verbal agreement is for a 2-year lease, it falls squarely under the Statute of Frauds and is therefore unenforceable as a 2-year lease.\n\n2.  **What Happens Instead (If the Tenant Moves In):**\n    *   If the tenant moves in and the landlord accepts rent, a **month-to-month tenancy** is typically created by operation of law. This means:\n        *   The tenancy continues on a month-to-month basis.\n        *   Either the landlord or the tenant can terminate the tenancy by providing proper written notice (usually 30, 60, or 90 days depending on how long the tenant has resided in the unit, as per NYC's Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019).\n        *   The landlord can raise the rent with proper notice.\n        *   Neither party is bound to a 2-year term.\n\n3.  **What if No One Has Moved In Yet?**\n    *   If no one has taken possession and no rent has been paid, the verbal agreement is simply an unenforceable promise. Neither party can compel the other to enter into the lease or pay damages for breach of the 2-year term.\n\n4.  **Limited Exception: Part Performance (Very High Bar)**\n    *   In rare circumstances, a court *might* enforce a verbal agreement for a lease longer than one year under the doctrine of \"part performance.\" However, this is a very high bar to meet. The actions taken must be \"unequivocally referable\" to the alleged agreement and inconsistent with any other explanation. Simply moving in and paying a month's rent is usually not enough to prove a *2-year* lease, as it's consistent with a month-to-month tenancy. This exception is typically reserved for situations where a tenant has made substantial, permanent improvements to the property *specifically in reliance* on a long-term lease agreement.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nA verbal agreement for a 2-year lease in NYC is generally not enforceable. If the tenant moves in and pays rent, a month-to-month tenancy is created.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nTo protect both parties, any lease agreement for more than one year should always be in writing and signed by both the landlord and the tenant.",
            "llama3": "A verbal agreement! That can be tricky.\n\nIn general, a verbal agreement is not considered a legally binding contract, and that includes leases. In most jurisdictions, written contracts are required for leases to be enforceable. However, there are some exceptions and considerations:\n\n**Your situation:** Since you verbally agreed to a 2-year lease, it's essential to understand the laws in your area regarding verbal agreements.\n\n1. **Statute of frauds**: Some states have statutes that require certain types of contracts, including leases, to be in writing to be enforceable. This means that if your state has such a statute, a verbal agreement might not be considered valid.\n2. **Estoppel**: If you've already taken possession of the property and are currently occupying it under the terms of the verbal agreement, you might argue that you've been estopped from denying the lease's validity. This means that you're essentially being stopped from denying the lease because you've already acted as if the lease was in place.\n3. **Equitable relief**: Courts may consider granting equitable relief, such as specific performance or injunctive relief, to enforce a verbal agreement. However, this is typically reserved for situations where there's a strong case for enforcement and the other party has taken significant steps based on the verbal agreement.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1. **Confirm in writing**: Reach out to your landlord and request that they confirm the lease terms in writing. This could be an email or letter detailing the agreement, including rent, duration, and any other relevant terms.\n2. **Seek legal advice**: Consult with a lawyer who's familiar with real estate law in your area. They can help you understand the specific laws applicable to your situation and provide guidance on how to proceed.\n3. **Negotiate an amendment**: If you're unable to get a written lease, consider negotiating an amendment that formalizes the agreement.\n\n**What about enforcement?**\n\nIf you decide to seek legal action to enforce the verbal lease, be prepared for the following:\n\n1. **Standard of proof**: You'll need to prove that a valid oral contract existed and that the other party breached its terms.\n2. **Lack of written evidence**: Without a written agreement, it may be more challenging to demonstrate the existence and terms of the lease.\n3. **Court discretion**: The court's decision will depend on the specific circumstances and applicable laws.\n\nIn summary, while verbal agreements are generally not considered legally binding contracts, there might be situations where a court could enforce a 2-year lease agreement. It's essential to understand the laws in your area and seek legal advice to determine the best course of action for your situation."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, absolutely. In New York City, if your apartment is rent-stabilized, your landlord is legally required to provide you with a **Rent Stabilization Lease Rider** at the time you sign a new lease (a \"vacancy lease\") or a renewal lease.\n\nThis requirement is mandated by the **Rent Stabilization Code (RSC)**, specifically Section 2522.5(c) for vacancy leases and Section 2523.1 for renewal leases. The **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)** further reinforced tenant protections and the importance of transparency regarding rent-stabilized tenancies.\n\n### What the Rent Stabilization Lease Rider Should Include:\n\nThe rider serves as a crucial document informing you of your rights and the specifics of your rent-stabilized tenancy. It should contain, at a minimum, the following information:\n\n1.  **Statement of Rent Stabilization:** A clear declaration that the apartment is subject to the Rent Stabilization Law and Code.\n2.  **Legal Regulated Rent (LRR):** The maximum legal rent the landlord is allowed to charge for the apartment.\n3.  **Preferential Rent (if applicable):** If your landlord is charging you a rent lower than the Legal Regulated Rent, this is called a \"preferential rent.\" The rider must clearly state both the Legal Regulated Rent and the preferential rent being charged.\n4.  **Rent History (especially for vacancy leases):**\n    *   For a **vacancy lease** (when you're a new tenant), the rider must state the legal regulated rent for the prior tenant and explain how the current legal regulated rent was calculated (e.g., vacancy increase, Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI) increases, Major Capital Improvement (MCI) increases, if applicable).\n    *   For a **renewal lease**, it should show the legal regulated rent from the previous lease and how the new legal regulated rent was calculated based on the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) increases.\n5.  **Tenant Rights and Protections:**\n    *   Your right to a renewal lease.\n    *   Your right to challenge the rent being charged.\n    *   Your right to essential services.\n    *   Protection from harassment and unlawful eviction.\n    *   Information about the landlord's obligation to register the apartment annually with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).\n6.  **DHCR Information:** Contact information for the DHCR and how to file a complaint or obtain information about your apartment's rent history.\n7.  **Lease Term and Parties:** The names of the landlord and tenant(s), the apartment address, and the term of the lease.\n8.  **Signatures:** Spaces for both the landlord (or their agent) and the tenant(s) to sign and date the rider, acknowledging receipt and understanding.\n\n### What You Should Do:\n\nSince your landlord gave you a lease but no rider:\n\n1.  **Request it in Writing:** Immediately send a written request (email or certified mail is best) to your landlord asking for the Rent Stabilization Lease Rider. Keep a copy for your records.\n2.  **Know Your Rights:** Even without the rider, your apartment is still rent-stabilized if it meets the criteria. The rider is an informational requirement.\n3.  **Consequences for the Landlord:** A landlord who fails to provide a required rent stabilization rider may be unable to collect any rent increases until the rider is provided. It can also be a factor in a rent overcharge complaint.\n4.  **Contact DHCR or a Tenant Attorney:** If your landlord refuses to provide the rider after you request it, or if you have concerns about the rent being charged, you should contact the DHCR or consult with a tenant attorney specializing in NYC housing law. They can help you understand your specific rights and options.\n\nIt's crucial to have this rider as it provides transparency and a clear record of your rent-stabilized status and rights.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, a rent-stabilized lease is required to have a Rent Stabilization Lease Rider (RSR) or a Rent Control Lease Rider (RCLR), depending on the tenant's situation. A RSR applies to tenants whose rent stabilized lease began after January 1, 1997, while an RCLR applies to tenants whose rent controlled lease began before that date.\n\nThe RSR/RCLR serves as an addendum to the standard lease agreement and outlines specific provisions related to rent stabilization. Here are some essential components it should include:\n\n1. **Rent Stabilization Registration Number**: This is a unique number assigned by the New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) or the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB). It confirms that the building is rent stabilized.\n2. **Initial Rent**: The RSR/RCLR should specify the initial rent charged at the beginning of the lease term.\n3. **Rent Increase Percentage**: The rider should indicate the percentage by which the landlord may increase the rent each year, as governed by the Rent Guidelines Board's annual guidelines.\n4. **Rent Overcharge Protection**: This provision ensures that the tenant is protected from overcharges in case the landlord fails to file a rent registration statement or misclassifies the apartment.\n5. **Vacancy Allowance**: The RSR/RCLR should outline the vacancy allowance, which is the percentage of the initial rent that the landlord can increase it by when the apartment becomes vacant.\n6. **Renovation and Capital Improvements**: This provision governs how renovations and capital improvements affect the rent. It may specify limits on rent increases or require the landlord to file a revised rent registration statement.\n7. **Sublets and Assignments**: The RSR/RCLR should outline the procedures for subletting or assigning the lease, including any restrictions or notification requirements.\n8. **Security Deposits**: This provision details the security deposit's purpose (e.g., to cover damages), maximum amount, and how it will be returned or applied when the tenant moves out.\n\nIf your landlord has failed to provide a RSR/RCLR with the initial lease, they may still be required to offer one upon request. You can contact the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) or the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) for guidance on what you should do in this situation.\n\nRemember that rent stabilization laws are complex and subject to change. If you have any questions or concerns, it's always a good idea to consult with an attorney or a tenant advocacy organization for personalized advice."

Here are some key considerations:\n\n1. **State laws:** Exculpatory clauses may be invalid or have specific restrictions depending on your state's laws. Some states prohibit exculpatory clauses for personal injuries altogether, while others allow them but require certain language or procedures.\n2. **Reasonableness and fairness:** Courts will review the clause to ensure it's reasonable and fair. If the clause is deemed overly broad or oppressive, a court may strike it down as unconscionable.\n3. **Notice:** The landlord must provide clear and conspicuous notice of the exculpatory clause in the lease. This means the clause should be prominently displayed, easy to read, and understandable by a reasonable person.\n4. **Waiver of liability:** If you signed the lease without reading or understanding the exculpatory clause, your agreement may not be enforceable.\n5. **Landlord's duty to maintain the property:** Even if an exculpatory clause is valid, a landlord still has a duty to maintain the property in a safe condition. If they fail to do so and you're injured as a result, you may still have grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nTo challenge the validity of the exculpatory clause, you'll need to consult with an attorney who's familiar with your state's laws and lease contract practices. They can help you determine if the clause is enforceable and advise on the best course of action in case you're injured while renting the property.\n\nIn summary, while a lease clause that absolves the landlord of liability for negligence may be valid under certain circumstances, its enforcement depends on various factors, including state laws, reasonableness, notice, waiver of liability, and the landlord's duty to maintain the property. It's always best to consult with an attorney if you have concerns about your lease agreement."

Additionally, courts have developed certain guidelines to determine whether these waivers are valid and enforceable:\n\n1. **Conspicuousness**: The language used must be clear and conspicuous, making it reasonably likely that a tenant would notice the waiver.\n2. **Knowledge**: You must have actual knowledge or constructive knowledge of the waiver (i.e., you should have been aware of the clause if you had read the lease carefully).\n3. **Reasonableness**: Courts may scrutinize whether the waiver is reasonable in light of the circumstances and the tenant's situation.\n\nIf your lease contains such a clause, it's crucial to consult with an attorney specializing in landlord-tenant law to determine its enforceability in your jurisdiction. Even if the clause appears valid, your lawyer can help you negotiate a settlement or pursue alternative legal options if necessary.\n\nIt's also important to note that some states have laws prohibiting waivers of jury trials for certain types of cases, such as personal injury claims. In these situations, even if your lease contains a waiver, it might not be enforceable in court.\n\nBefore proceeding with any lawsuit against your landlord, I strongly recommend consulting with an attorney who can assess the validity of the waiver and advise you on the best course of action."

This generally means you achieved the main objective of the litigation. It's not always straightforward and can be a point of contention, especially in cases that settle.\n4.  **Scope:** This applies to \"any action or summary proceeding\" arising out of the lease, such as non-payment cases, holdover cases, or actions concerning lease violations or the warranty of habitability.\n\n**In summary:** Because your lease grants your landlord the right to recover attorney's fees if they sue you and win, RPL 234 automatically grants *you* the same right to recover attorney's fees and costs if *you* sue your landlord (or defend against their suit) and prevail.\n\nIt's always a good idea to consult with a housing attorney if you find yourself in a dispute with your landlord to understand your specific rights and options.",
            "llama3": "In most states, a provision in the lease allowing the landlord to recover attorney's fees and costs does not necessarily mean you are prohibited from recovering them as well.\n\nAbsent a specific clause in your lease stating otherwise, you likely still have the right to seek reimbursement of attorney's fees and costs if you need to defend yourself against a lawsuit brought by your landlord. This is because many states follow the \"prevailing party\" rule, which means that the prevailing party (the one who wins the lawsuit) is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs from the losing party.\n\nIn this case, if you were to prevail in the lawsuit, you would be the prevailing party and would likely be entitled to recover your attorney's fees and costs. Similarly, if you lost the lawsuit but had a valid defense or mitigating circumstances, you might still have a claim for reimbursement of your attorney's fees and costs.\n\nTo confirm your rights, you may want to consult with an attorney familiar with the laws in your state.

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, absolutely. In New York City, a court can and often will refuse to enforce a lease clause that is deemed unfair, illegal, or against public policy. This is a critical protection for tenants, especially given the significant power imbalance that often exists between landlords and tenants.\n\nHere are the primary reasons a court might refuse to enforce a lease clause in NYC:\n\n1.  **Unconscionability (Real Property Law \u00a7 235-c):**\n    This is the most direct answer to \"extremely unfair.\" New York Real Property Law (RPL) \u00a7 235-c specifically allows a court to refuse to enforce an unconscionable lease or any unconscionable clause within a lease.\n    *   **What it means:** A clause is generally considered unconscionable if it is so one-sided, oppressive, and unfair that no reasonable person would agree to it, and no honest person would attempt to enforce it. Courts look at two aspects:\n        *   **Procedural Unconscionability:** How the clause was formed (e.g., unequal bargaining power, hidden terms, complex language, lack of opportunity to understand).\n        *   **Substantive Unconscionability:** The terms of the clause itself (e.g., overly harsh, oppressive, disproportionate, no reasonable commercial purpose).\n    *   **Court's Power:** If a court finds a clause to be unconscionable, it can:\n        *   Refuse to enforce the entire lease.\n        *   Refuse to enforce only the unconscionable clause.\n        *   Limit the application of the unconscionable clause to avoid an unconscionable result.\n\n2.  **Violation of Law or Public Policy:**\n    Many clauses are unenforceable because they attempt to waive rights or impose obligations that are contrary to existing laws or fundamental public policy. This is very common in NYC housing. Examples include:\n    *   **Waiver of Warranty of Habitability (RPL \u00a7 235-b):** Any clause that attempts to make a tenant waive their right to a safe, sanitary, and livable apartment is void and unenforceable.\n    *   **Waiver of Rent Stabilization/ETPA Rights:** In rent-stabilized apartments, any clause that attempts to waive a tenant's rights under the Rent Stabilization Code or the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (ETPA) is void. This includes rights to renewal leases, to challenge rent overcharges, or to succession.\n    *   **Illegal Fees:** Clauses imposing fees not permitted by law (e.g., application fees beyond the legal limit, excessive late fees, move-in/move-out fees not tied to actual services).\n        *   *Note:* Late fees are capped at $50 or 5% of the monthly rent, whichever is less (RPL \u00a7 238-a).\n        *   *Note:* Security deposits are capped at one month's rent (RPL \u00a7 238-a).\n    *   **Indemnification for Landlord's Negligence (General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-321):** A clause that attempts to make a tenant responsible for injuries or damages caused by the landlord's own negligence is void and unenforceable.\n    *   **Attorneys' Fees (RPL \u00a7 234):** If a lease gives the landlord the right to recover attorneys' fees for legal actions, RPL \u00a7 234 automatically creates a reciprocal right for the tenant to recover attorneys' fees if they prevail. Any clause attempting to deny this reciprocal right is unenforceable.\n    *   **Clauses Requiring Tenant to Make Landlord's Repairs:** While tenants are responsible for minor repairs due to their own negligence, clauses that shift the landlord's fundamental responsibility to maintain the premises (e.g., structural repairs, plumbing, heating) to the tenant are generally unenforceable.\n    *   **Waiver of Right to Jury Trial:** While often included, these clauses are sometimes challenged and their enforceability can depend on specific circumstances and the court's interpretation.\n\n3.  **Ambiguity:**\n    If a clause is vague, unclear, or open to multiple interpretations, a court will generally interpret it against the party who drafted the lease (which is almost always the landlord).\n\n**What to Do if You Have Such a Clause:**\n\n1.  **Do Not Assume It's Unenforceable:** While many unfair clauses are indeed unenforceable, you should not unilaterally decide to ignore it.\n2.  **Seek Legal Advice:** The best course of action is to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant's rights organization in NYC. They can review your specific lease clause, explain your rights, and advise you on the likelihood of a court refusing to enforce it.\n3.  **Gather Documentation:** Have your lease readily available for review.\n\nIn summary, NYC law provides significant protections against unfair lease clauses. If you believe a clause in your lease is \"extremely unfair,\" there's a good chance a court would agree and refuse to enforce it, either because it's unconscionable or because it violates specific tenant protection laws.",
            "llama3": "The age-old concern about pesky lease clauses! While courts generally prioritize enforcing contracts as written, they may refuse to enforce an unreasonable or unconscionable term if:\n\n1. **It's against public policy**: The clause is contrary to the law or a fundamental right. For example, a provision requiring tenants to waive their right to seek medical attention in case of an emergency might be deemed unenforceable.\n2. **It's overly broad or vague**: A court may decline to enforce a term that is so ambiguous it would lead to confusion or create uncertainty.\n3. **It's a penalty clause**: If the clause imposes a disproportionate penalty on you, it might be considered unenforceable. For instance, if your landlord tries to charge an exorbitant fee for a minor infraction.\n4. **It's unconscionable**: The clause is so one-sided or oppressive that it would cause significant hardship or harm. In such cases, the court may declare the term null and void.\n\nTo challenge the clause in court, you'll need to demonstrate that the provision is unreasonable, overly broad, a penalty, or unconscionable. You can do this by:\n\n1. **Arguing it's against public policy**: Show how the clause contradicts laws or fundamental rights.\n2. **Demonstrating vagueness**: Highlight the ambiguity of the term and how it would lead to confusion or uncertainty.\n3. **Showing disproportionate penalty**: Calculate the impact of the penalty on you and argue that it's unfairly punitive.\n4. **Establishing unconscionability**: Present evidence showing how the clause would cause significant hardship or harm.\n\nIf you're successful in your challenge, the court may:\n\n1. **Strike down the provision**: Declare the offending term invalid and unenforceable.\n2. **Modify the provision**: Change the term to make it more reasonable or fair.\n3. **Order specific relief**: Compel your landlord to take a certain action or refrain from doing something.\n\nBefore taking legal action, consider the following:\n\n1. Review your lease carefully: Make sure you understand the scope of the offending clause and its potential impact on you.\n2. Consult with an attorney: A lawyer can help you determine if the clause is indeed unenforceable and provide guidance on how to proceed.\n3. Seek mediation or negotiation: Try to resolve the issue amicably by discussing the matter with your landlord.\n\nRemember that courts generally favor enforcing contracts as written, so it's essential to build a strong case before challenging an unfair lease term."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, under New York law, your landlord generally **must** warn you about an automatic renewal clause in your lease.\n\nThis is governed by **New York General Obligations Law (GOL) \u00a7 5-905**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the requirements:\n\n1.  **The Requirement:** If your lease contains a clause that automatically renews the lease unless you (the tenant) give notice of your intent not to renew, the landlord is legally required to provide you with written notice calling your attention to that clause.\n\n2.  **When:** This written notice must be given to you:\n    *   **Not less than 15 days**\n    *   **And not more than 30 days**\n    *   ***Before*** the date you are required to notify the landlord of your intention not to renew.\n\n    *Example:* If your lease states you must notify the landlord by June 1st if you don't want the lease to automatically renew, the landlord must send you the warning notice between May 2nd (30 days before) and May 17th (15 days before).\n\n3.  **What Happens if the Landlord Fails to Give Notice?**\n    If the landlord fails to provide this timely written notice, the automatic renewal clause is **unenforceable**. This means you would not be bound by the automatic renewal, even if the clause is in your lease.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Purpose:** This law is designed to protect tenants from inadvertently being bound to another lease term simply because they forgot about an automatic renewal clause.\n*   **Applicability:** GOL \u00a7 5-905 applies to both residential and commercial leases in New York.\n*   **Distinction from Other Notices:** This is distinct from a landlord's general obligation to offer a renewal lease (especially for rent-stabilized tenants) or to provide notice of non-renewal or rent increases. Those are separate requirements.\n\n**In summary:** If your lease has an automatic renewal clause, your landlord must send you a specific written reminder about it within a specific timeframe (15-30 days before your deadline to opt out). If they don't, you are not bound by that automatic renewal.",
            "llama3": "The pesky automatic renewal clause! Yes, your landlord is required to notify you about the upcoming automatic renewal of your lease. The timing and method of notification vary depending on your location and the specific terms of your lease. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Federal Law:** Under federal law (Residential Leases), if your lease has an automatic renewal clause, your landlord must provide written notice to you at least 30 days before the end of your initial lease term. This notice should inform you that the lease will automatically renew for a specified period (e.g., another year).\n2. **State Laws:** Some states have their own specific laws regarding automatic renewal clauses in residential leases. For example:\n\t* In California, the landlord must provide written notice at least 30 days before the end of the initial lease term.\n\t* In Florida, the landlord must notify the tenant by certified mail or personal service at least 15 days before the end of the initial lease term.\n\t* In New York, the landlord must provide written notice at least 10 days before the end of the initial lease term.\n\nCheck your state's laws for specific requirements. You can search online or consult with a local attorney if you're unsure about the laws in your area.\n\n3. **Lease Terms:** Even if there is no specific requirement by federal or state law, your lease agreement may still have its own provisions regarding automatic renewal notice. Review your lease carefully to see if it specifies when and how you'll be notified.\n\nTo ensure you receive proper notification, make sure to:\n\n* Carefully review your lease agreement\n* Pay attention to any notices or correspondence from your landlord\n* Keep track of the expiration date of your initial lease term\n\nIf you're unsure about the automatic renewal clause in your lease or haven't received a notice from your landlord, it's always a good idea to reach out to them and confirm the details."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "This is a common question, and the answer largely depends on whether your apartment is **rent-stabilized**, which most apartments in NYC are if they are in buildings with 6 or more units built before 1974, or if they received certain tax abatements.\n\n**Assuming your apartment is Rent-Stabilized (which is the most common scenario for a formal lease renewal offer):**\n\n1.  **How long do they have to send back the fully executed lease?**\n    *   **There is no specific statutory deadline** under the Rent Stabilization Code for a landlord to return the *fully executed* (signed by both parties) lease to the tenant after the tenant has signed and returned their copy.\n    *   **However, once you sign and return the renewal offer, a binding agreement is generally formed.** The landlord cannot unilaterally withdraw the offer or change the terms after you've accepted it within the 60-day window.\n    *   **Best Practice:** Landlords should return a fully executed copy within a **reasonable timeframe**, typically a few weeks to a month. If it's been longer than that, it's reasonable to follow up in writing (email is good) to request your copy.\n    *   **Your Protection:** Keep a copy of the renewal offer you signed and returned to the landlord. This is your proof that you accepted the renewal.\n\n2.  **Do I have to pay the rent increase before I get it?**\n    *   **Yes, generally you do.** The new rent amount, as stated in the renewal offer you signed, becomes effective on the **start date of the new lease term**, regardless of whether you have received the fully executed copy yet.\n    *   Your obligation to pay the new rent begins on that date because you accepted the terms of the renewal offer. The physical return of the landlord's signed copy is a formality to complete your records, but it doesn't change the effective date of the new lease term or the rent increase.\n\n**Key Takeaways & What to Do:**\n\n*   **Keep Records:** Always make a copy of any lease renewal offer you sign and return to your landlord. This is crucial proof of your acceptance.\n*   **Follow Up:** If you haven't received your fully executed lease within a reasonable time (e.g., 3-4 weeks), send a polite written request to your landlord or management company asking for it.\n*   **Pay the New Rent:** Be prepared to pay the increased rent starting from the effective date of your new lease term.\n*   **If Your Apartment is NOT Rent-Stabilized:** If your apartment is market-rate, the rules are different. Landlords are not required to offer renewals, and the terms are entirely negotiable. However, if they *did* offer a renewal and you signed it, the principles of contract law would still apply, meaning your acceptance generally forms a binding agreement, and the new rent would be due on the new lease term's start date.\n\nIf you encounter significant delays or issues, you can contact NYS Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR), which oversees rent-stabilized apartments, or seek advice from a housing attorney or tenant advocacy group.",
            "llama3": "Congratulations on renewing your lease!\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a landlord has a certain timeframe to provide you with a fully executed lease agreement after you've signed the renewal. The specific timeline may vary depending on your location, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. In California: Your landlord typically has 30 days from the date of your signed renewal to deliver a fully executed lease agreement (Cal. Civ. Code \u00a71947.9).\n2. In New York: Your landlord usually has 14 days to provide you with a fully executed lease agreement after you've signed the renewal (N.Y. Real Prop. Law \u00a7235-b).\n3. In most other states: The timeframe may vary, but it's typically around 10-30 days.\n\nAs for paying the rent increase before receiving the fully executed lease, it depends on your specific situation:\n\n1. If the rent increase is part of a new lease agreement that you've signed, you should only be required to pay the increased rent when the new lease takes effect.\n2. If you're being asked to pay the increased rent in advance (e.g., before receiving the fully executed lease), you may want to negotiate with your landlord or seek clarification on this point.\n\nBefore making any payments, consider asking your landlord:\n\n* Can I review a fully executed lease agreement before paying the increased rent?\n* What is the effective date of the new lease and when will I need to start paying the increased rent?\n* Are there any other changes or updates to the lease that I should be aware of?\n\nRemember to carefully review the terms of your renewed lease and ask questions if you're unsure about any provisions."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, in NYC, if you stayed after your lease ended and your landlord continued to accept your rent payments, you are **very likely considered a month-to-month tenant**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why and what it means:\n\n1.  **Implied Agreement:** When a lease expires, and the tenant remains in possession while the landlord continues to accept rent, the law generally implies a new tenancy. Since there's no new written agreement specifying a term, it defaults to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord's acceptance of rent is seen as an acknowledgment and acceptance of your continued occupancy.\n\n2.  **Conversion from Holdover:** Initially, after your lease expired, you were technically a \"holdover tenant.\" However, the landlord's subsequent acceptance of rent typically converts that holdover into a new, implied month-to-month tenancy.\n\n**Important Distinction for NYC Tenants:**\n\n*   **Market-Rate (Unregulated) Tenants:** If your apartment is market-rate, then yes, you are almost certainly a month-to-month tenant under these circumstances.\n*   **Rent-Stabilized Tenants:** This is a crucial difference in NYC. If your apartment is rent-stabilized, your landlord **cannot** simply convert you to a month-to-month tenant by letting your lease expire and accepting rent. Under rent stabilization laws, the landlord is obligated to offer you a renewal lease (for a 1- or 2-year term) before your current lease expires. If they fail to offer a renewal lease but continue to accept rent, you generally retain your rights as a rent-stabilized tenant, and the landlord may still be compelled to offer you a renewal lease. You are not simply a month-to-month tenant in the same way a market-rate tenant would be.\n\n**What Being a Month-to-Month Tenant Means (for Market-Rate):**\n\n*   **Termination:** Either you or your landlord can terminate the tenancy by providing proper written notice.\n    *   **Tenant:** You typically need to give at least one month's notice before the next rent due date.\n    *   **Landlord:** The landlord must provide written notice, and the required notice period depends on how long you've lived in the apartment:\n        *   **Less than 1 year:** 30 days' notice\n        *   **1 year to less than 2 years:** 60 days' notice\n        *   **2 years or more:** 90 days' notice\n*   **Rent Increases:** Your landlord can increase your rent, but they must also provide the same notice periods as for termination (30, 60, or 90 days) before the increase takes effect.\n*   **All other lease terms:** Generally, all other terms and conditions of your expired lease (e.g., pet policies, maintenance responsibilities) continue to apply to your month-to-month tenancy.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nGiven your description, for a market-rate apartment, you are almost certainly a month-to-month tenant. If you are in a rent-stabilized apartment, your rights are stronger, and you likely still have the right to a renewal lease.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance and not legal advice. Housing laws can be complex, and specific circumstances can alter outcomes. If you have concerns or questions about your specific situation, especially if you are rent-stabilized or facing potential eviction, it's highly recommended to consult with a qualified NYC housing attorney or tenant advocacy organization.",
            "llama3": "The perpetual conundrum of the expired lease!\n\nIn most states, when a lease expires, the tenancy automatically converts to a month-to-month tenancy (also known as a periodic tenancy) unless one party gives written notice to the other. This means that the tenant and landlord are bound by the same terms and conditions as before, but with some key differences:\n\n1. **No longer bound by original lease**: The expired lease no longer applies, and the parties are not obligated to follow its specific terms.\n2. **Month-to-month terms**: The tenancy now operates on a month-by-month basis, with the rent being due on the same day it was before (e.g., the first of the month).\n3. **Notice requirements**: To terminate the tenancy, either party must provide written notice to the other, typically 30 days or more in advance.\n\nIn your case, since you stayed after the lease ended and the landlord continued accepting rent, you can be considered a month-to-month tenant. However, it's essential to note that:\n\n1. **The landlord may not have explicitly converted the tenancy**: Without written confirmation from both parties, the landlord might not have formally notified you of the conversion.\n2. **You may still have rights under your original lease**: If the expired lease contained provisions favorable to you (e.g., a longer notice period), those rights may still apply.\n\nTo clarify your situation and protect yourself, consider taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the landlord's intentions**: Request written confirmation from the landlord that they are treating you as a month-to-month tenant.\n2. **Review your lease**: Carefully review your original lease to understand what provisions might still apply.\n3. **Consider updating your agreement**: If you're comfortable with the new terms, ask the landlord to formally convert the tenancy and confirm the monthly rent and notice requirements.\n\nRemember that laws regarding month-to-month tenancies vary by state, so it's always a good idea to consult local regulations or seek legal advice if you're unsure about your specific situation."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "You're asking a very important question, and the answer for **New York City** is nuanced due to strong tenant protections, particularly the **Good Cause Eviction** law.\n\nHere's a breakdown based on NYC law:\n\n### Can a Landlord Terminate a Month-to-Month Tenancy Without a Reason in NYC?\n\n**Generally, NO, not for most tenants in NYC.**\n\nNew York City's **Good Cause Eviction** law (part of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019) generally requires landlords to have a \"good cause\" to terminate a tenancy, even a month-to-month one, or to refuse to renew a lease. This means a landlord usually **cannot simply tell you to leave without providing a legally recognized reason.**\n\n**What constitutes \"Good Cause\"?** Examples include:\n*   Non-payment of rent\n*   Violating a substantial obligation of your tenancy (e.g., consistently disturbing other tenants, illegal activity)\n*   Using the unit for illegal purposes\n*   Willfully damaging the apartment\n*   The landlord seeking to recover the apartment for their own primary residence or that of a family member (under specific conditions)\n*   Demolition of the building\n*   Withdrawal of the unit from the rental market\n\n**However, there are important exceptions to the Good Cause Eviction law:**\n\nThe Good Cause Eviction law **does NOT apply** to certain types of housing, including:\n*   **Owner-occupied buildings with three or fewer units.** If your landlord lives in the same building and there are three or fewer apartments total, they might be exempt.\n*   Units where the rent is 300% or more of the fair market rent for the area (a very high threshold).\n*   Units subject to rent control or rent stabilization (these have their own, even stronger, protections).\n*   Units where the tenant is an employee of the landlord.\n*   Units in co-ops or condominiums.\n\n**Therefore:**\n*   **If your building is NOT exempt from Good Cause Eviction:** Your landlord **must have a legally recognized reason** to terminate your month-to-month tenancy. They cannot simply say \"I want you to leave\" without a cause.\n*   **If your building IS exempt from Good Cause Eviction (e.g., owner-occupied 3-family):** Then, yes, your landlord *could* terminate your month-to-month tenancy without stating a specific \"good cause,\" but they **still must provide proper written notice.**\n\n### How Much Notice Does a Landlord Need to Give?\n\nRegardless of whether a reason is required or not, your landlord **must provide you with written notice** to terminate your tenancy. The amount of notice depends on how long you've lived in the apartment:\n\n*   **If you have occupied the unit for less than one year:** Your landlord must give you at least **30 days' written notice**.\n*   **If you have occupied the unit for one year to less than two years:** Your landlord must give you at least **60 days' written notice**.\n*   **If you have occupied the unit for two years or more:** Your landlord must give you at least **90 days' written notice**.\n\nThis notice must be in writing and properly served.\n\n### What You Should Do:\n\n1.  **Do NOT move out immediately.** Your landlord cannot legally force you out without a court order.\n2.  **Determine if your building is exempt from Good Cause Eviction.** This is the crucial first step.\n3.  **Check if your apartment is rent-stabilized.** Many tenants in NYC are unaware they live in a rent-stabilized unit, which offers even greater protections. You can check the NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) website or call them.\n4.  **Seek legal advice immediately.** Contact a tenant rights organization, Legal Aid Society, or a private attorney specializing in housing law. They can help you understand your specific rights and options based on your situation.\n5.  **Document everything.** Keep copies of any notices, communications, and records related to your tenancy.\n\nIt's critical to understand your rights, as simply being told to leave without a reason is often not allowed under NYC law.",

This can include:\n\n* Non-payment of rent\n* Material breach of lease (e.g., damage to the property)\n* Unlawful activity on the premises\n* Failure to comply with health and safety codes\n\nIf your landlord fails to provide a valid reason, they may be unable to terminate your tenancy.\n\nAs for the notice period, California law requires a landlord to provide at least 30 days' written notice to terminate a month-to-month tenancy.

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "As a housing law assistant, I can tell you that in NYC, whether your landlord can raise your rent on a month-to-month lease without your explicit agreement depends on a crucial factor: **whether your apartment is rent-stabilized or unregulated (market-rate).**\n\nHere's a breakdown based on NYC law:\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 1: Your Apartment is Rent-Stabilized or Rent-Controlled\n\n**No, your landlord generally cannot simply raise your rent on a month-to-month basis without your agreement if your apartment is rent-stabilized.**\n\n*   **Right to a Lease Renewal:** If your apartment is rent-stabilized, you have a right to a renewal lease for a term of one or two years. The landlord *must* offer you a renewal lease between 90 and 150 days before your current lease expires.\n*   **Rent Increases are Regulated:** Any rent increase on a rent-stabilized apartment must be in accordance with the rates set by the NYC Rent Guidelines Board (RGB).\n*   **Month-to-Month is Unusual:** If you are truly on a month-to-month tenancy in a rent-stabilized apartment, it's often because:\n    *   Your landlord failed to offer you a renewal lease. In this case, you have the right to remain in the apartment and continue paying the previous rent. You can also file a complaint with the NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR).\n    *   You refused a renewal lease offer. If you refused a proper renewal offer, you might be considered a month-to-month tenant, but the landlord still cannot unilaterally raise the rent beyond RGB guidelines without offering a new lease.\n\n**Key Takeaway for Stabilized Apartments:** If your apartment is rent-stabilized, your landlord cannot just impose a rent increase on a month-to-month basis. You have specific rights to a lease renewal at regulated rates.\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Your Apartment is Unregulated (Market-Rate)\n\n**Yes, your landlord can raise your rent on a month-to-month lease without your explicit agreement, but they must provide proper written notice.**\n\nFor unregulated month-to-month tenancies in NYC, the landlord can change the terms of the tenancy, including the rent, by providing you with advance written notice. Your continued occupancy after the notice period implies your agreement to the new terms. If you do not agree to the new rent, your option is to vacate the apartment by the effective date of the increase.\n\nThe required notice period for a rent increase (or non-renewal of tenancy) depends on how long you've lived in the apartment:\n\n*   **If you have occupied the apartment for less than one year:** The landlord must give you at least **30 days' written notice** of the rent increase.\n*   **If you have occupied the apartment for one year but less than two years:** The landlord must give you at least **60 days' written notice** of the rent increase.\n*   **If you have occupied the apartment for two years or more:** The landlord must give you at least **90 days' written notice** of the rent increase.\n\n**Important Considerations for Unregulated Apartments:**\n\n*   **Written Notice is Key:** The notice must be in writing and delivered properly.\n*   **Effective Date:** The rent increase cannot take effect until the required notice period has passed. If your landlord gives you less than the required notice, the increase is not valid until the full notice period has run.\n*   **Your Options:**\n    *   **Accept the new rent:** You continue living there and pay the increased amount.\n    *   **Negotiate:** You can try to negotiate a lower increase or a new lease term with your landlord.\n    *   **Move out:** If you don't agree to the new rent, you must move out before the effective date of the increase. If you stay and don't pay the new rent, your landlord could start an eviction proceeding.\n\n---\n\n### How to Determine if Your Apartment is Rent-Stabilized:\n\nIt's crucial to know if your apartment is rent-stabilized. You can check by:\n\n1.  **Looking at your lease:** It might state if the apartment is rent-stabilized.\n2.  **Contacting NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR):** You can call their Rent Info Line at 718-739-6400 or visit their website to request your apartment's rent history. This is the most definitive way.\n3.  **Checking with your building's management:** Though they may not always be forthcoming.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** If your apartment is unregulated and you're on a month-to-month lease, your landlord *can* raise your rent without your explicit agreement, provided they give you the legally required written notice based on your tenancy length. If your apartment is rent-stabilized, the rules are very different, and you have stronger protections against arbitrary rent increases.",
            "llama3": "The joys of renting! In most states, the answer is no, your landlord cannot increase your rent without your agreement or consent. Here's why:\n\n**Month-to-Month Leases**: Since you have a month-to-month lease, you and your landlord have an ongoing oral or written agreement to rent the property for a short period (usually one month at a time). In this scenario, your landlord must provide you with written notice of any changes to the rental terms, including rent increases.\n\n**Notice Requirements**: The specific notice requirements vary by state and locality. Typically, your landlord must give you:\n\n1. Written notice: This is usually 30-60 days' written notice before the new rent takes effect.\n2. Specific details: The notice should specify the date of the rent increase, the new rent amount, and any other changes to the lease terms.\n\n**Exceptions**: There might be situations where your landlord can raise your rent without your consent:\n\n1. **Rent control laws**: Some states or cities have rent control regulations that limit rent increases.\n2. **Lease renewal**: If your month-to-month lease is about to expire, and you haven't renewed it, your landlord may not need to provide additional notice before increasing the rent.\n\n**What can you do?**:\n\n1. Review your lease: Check your original lease agreement or any subsequent amendments to see if there are specific provisions governing rent increases.\n2. Negotiate with your landlord: If you're unhappy with the proposed rent increase, try negotiating a new rent amount or exploring other options, like a longer-term lease at a fixed rate.\n3. Consider a longer-term lease: If you're not comfortable with the potential for frequent rent increases, look into signing a longer-term lease (e.g., 6-12 months) to lock in your rent for a set period.\n\nRemember to always keep records of any communications with your landlord and to carefully review any notices or agreements related to rent increases."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "As a housing law assistant, I can tell you that in NYC, the general statute of limitations for challenging a rent increase in a rent-regulated apartment (i.e., filing a rent overcharge complaint) is **six years**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what that means:\n\n1.  **Six-Year Lookback Period:** When you file a rent overcharge complaint with the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR) or in court, the DHCR or court will generally examine the rent history for the six years immediately preceding the filing of your complaint. They will determine if the rent charged during that period was legal based on the apartment's regulatory status and the applicable rent guidelines.\n\n2.  **Impact of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) of 2019:** The HSTPA significantly strengthened tenant protections regarding rent overcharges. Before HSTPA, the lookback period was generally four years, and courts were often limited in how far back they could go even in cases of fraud. Now:\n    *   The lookback period is explicitly six years.\n    *   Crucially, in cases where there is evidence of a fraudulent scheme to deregulate an apartment or to charge an illegal rent, or where the rent history is otherwise unreliable, the DHCR or court can examine **all available rent history** for the apartment, potentially going back further than six years, to determine the legal regulated rent.\n\n**What to do if you suspect an illegal rent increase:**\n\n*   **Don't Delay:** While you have a six-year lookback, it's always best to challenge an increase as soon as you suspect it's illegal. The sooner you act, the more evidence might be available, and the easier it may be to resolve.\n*   **Gather Documents:** Collect all your leases, rent receipts, and any correspondence from your landlord regarding rent increases.\n*   **Request Rent History:** You can request the rent registration history for your apartment from the DHCR. This document will show the registered rent for your apartment going back to 1984 (or when it became regulated).\n*   **File a Complaint:** If you believe you've been overcharged, you can file a \"Tenant's Complaint of Rent Overcharge\" (Form RA-89) with the DHCR.\n*   **Seek Legal Advice:** Rent overcharge cases can be complex. It's highly recommended to consult with a housing attorney or a tenant advocacy organization. They can review your specific situation, help you understand your rights, and guide you through the process of filing a complaint.\n\nRemember, even if you've been paying an increased rent for some time, you may still be able to recover overcharges for the past six years (and potentially more in cases of fraud).",
            "llama3": "As a tenant in a rent-regulated apartment, you have the right to challenge a rent increase if you believe it's excessive or unlawful. The timeframe for challenging a rent increase varies depending on the jurisdiction and type of regulation.\n\nIn New York City, which has some of the most comprehensive rent regulations in the country, you typically have 14 days from the date of the rent increase notice to file an appeal with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). This is governed by Section 2523.1 of the Rent Stabilization Code.\n\nOutside of New York City, the timeframe may be different. For example:\n\n* In California, you have 15 days from the date of the rent increase notice to file a complaint with the State Department of Housing and Community Development.\n* In Massachusetts, you have 30 days from the date of the rent increase notice to file an appeal with the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development.\n\nIt's essential to review your lease or rental agreement and local laws to determine the specific timeframe for challenging a rent increase in your area. If you're unsure about the process or the deadline, it's always best to consult with an attorney specializing in landlord-tenant law.\n\nRemember to carefully review your rent increase notice and keep a record of any correspondence with your landlord or relevant authorities."

Its primary function is to meet annually and establish the maximum allowable rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments (and lofts, hotels, and SROs).\n2.  **Annual Process:** Each year, the RGB holds public hearings, reviews economic data (such as operating costs for landlords, tenant income, and the overall housing market), and then votes on the guidelines.\n3.  **Lease Terms:** The RGB typically sets different percentage increases for 1-year and 2-year lease renewals.\n4.  **Effective Date:** These guidelines apply to rent-stabilized leases commencing on or after a specific date, usually October 1st of that year.\n5.  **Binding Maximums:** Landlords of rent-stabilized apartments cannot charge more than the percentages set by the RGB for lease renewals.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Preferential Rents:** If you have a \"preferential rent\" (meaning your actual rent is lower than the legal regulated rent), your landlord can raise your rent to the legal regulated rent upon renewal, *plus* the RGB-approved increase.\n*   **Other Increases:** While the RGB sets the annual increase, there are other specific circumstances where a landlord might be able to increase rent beyond the annual guideline, such as for Major Capital Improvements (MCIs) or Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs), but these are separate processes and not part of the annual RGB decision.\n*   **DHCR:** The New York State Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR) is the state agency responsible for administering and enforcing the rent stabilization laws, but it's the NYC Rent Guidelines Board that sets the annual increase percentages.",

The RGB is an independent agency responsible for making decisions on rent adjustments to ensure that rents remain affordable and fair.\n\nHere's how the process works:\n\n1. **Annual Rent Adjustment**: In May of each year, the RGB holds public hearings to gather input from stakeholders, including tenants, landlords, and community organizations.\n2. **Data Collection**: The RGB collects data on operating costs (e.g., property taxes, insurance, maintenance) and other relevant factors that may affect rent levels.\n3. **Guidelines Setting**: Based on the data collected, the RGB sets a maximum rent increase for rent-stabilized apartments in New York City. This percentage is usually applied to the previous year's rent.\n\n**The Maximum Rent Increase**\n\nIn recent years, the maximum rent increases have been:\n\n* 2022: 3.5% (average of 2.5% and 4.5%, as per the RGB's guidelines)\n* 2021: 2.5%\n* 2020: 1.5%\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and actual rent increases may vary depending on factors specific to your building or landlord.\n\n**Landlord-Initiated Increases**\n\nWhile the RGB sets the overall maximum rent increase, landlords can still request a higher rent increase for their individual buildings if they can demonstrate significant operating costs or other justified reasons. These requests must be approved by the RGB and are subject to public review and comment.\n\nAs a rent-stabilized tenant, you'll receive notice of any rent increase from your landlord, which will include details on the new rent and any applicable changes. If you have concerns about a proposed rent increase, you can contact the RGB or seek guidance from a housing lawyer or advocacy organization.\n\nRemember to stay informed about changes in rent stabilization laws and guidelines to ensure that your rights as a tenant are protected!"

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "Yes, your landlord *can potentially* raise your rent for building-wide work like replacing a boiler or installing new equipment in a rent-stabilized building, but it's subject to very specific rules and limitations under NYC law, particularly as modified by the **Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (TPA)**.\n\nThis type of rent increase is known as a **Major Capital Improvement (MCI)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how MCIs work in rent-stabilized buildings:\n\n1.  **What Qualifies as an MCI?**\n    *   The improvement must be building-wide and for the operation, preservation, and maintenance of the building.\n    *   It must be depreciable under federal tax law (meaning it's a long-term asset, not a repair).\n    *   It must not be a repair or routine maintenance.\n    *   It must not be required to correct a violation of the Housing Maintenance Code (unless the improvement itself is necessary to fix the underlying condition causing the violation, e.g., a new roof to stop leaks).\n    *   **Examples:** Replacing a boiler, installing a new heating system, new roof, new windows, new elevator, new intercom system, building-wide electrical upgrades.\n\n2.  **The Application Process:**\n    *   The landlord cannot simply raise your rent. They must apply to the **New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)** for approval of the MCI.\n    *   The application must include detailed documentation of the work performed, its cost, and proof of payment.\n    *   Tenants in the building have the right to receive a copy of the application and submit objections or comments to the DHCR.\n\n3.  **Key Changes Under the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (TPA):**\n    The TPA significantly altered how MCIs impact rent-stabilized tenants:\n\n    *   **2% Cap:** The annual rent increase for an MCI is now capped at **2%** of the tenant's legal regulated rent. This is a major change from prior law, where increases could be much higher.\n    *   **Temporary Increase:** The MCI rent increase is no longer permanent. It is collected for **30 years**. After 30 years, the rent increase attributable to the MCI must be removed from the legal regulated rent.\n    *   **Amortization Period:** While the increase is collected for 30 years, the cost of the MCI is amortized over 12 years (144 months) for calculation purposes.\n    *   **Eligibility Criteria:** DHCR now has stricter criteria for approving MCIs, requiring that the improvements directly benefit tenants and are necessary for the preservation or maintenance of the building.\n\n4.  **What This Means for You:**\n    *   If your landlord replaces a boiler or installs new equipment that qualifies as an MCI, they can apply to DHCR for a rent increase.\n    *   Any approved increase will be capped at 2% of your current legal regulated rent per year.\n    *   This increase will be added to your rent for 30 years, after which it will be removed.\n\n**What You Should Do:**\n\n*   **Review the Notice:** If your landlord applies for an MCI, you will receive a notice from DHCR. Read it carefully.\n*   **Submit Objections:** You and your fellow tenants have the right to submit objections to DHCR. This is your opportunity to point out if the work was not properly done, was routine maintenance, or if the costs seem inflated.\n*   **Check DHCR Records:** You can check the DHCR website or contact them directly to see if an MCI application has been filed for your building or if any MCIs have been approved in the past.\n*   **Contact Tenant Organizations:** Organizations like Met Council on Housing, Housing Conservation Coordinators, or Legal Aid Society can provide invaluable assistance and advice on challenging MCI applications.\n\nIn summary, while your landlord can seek a rent increase for building-wide improvements like a new boiler, the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 has made these increases significantly less impactful for tenants by capping them at 2% annually and making them temporary for 30 years.",
            "llama3": "In a rent-stabilized building, the answer depends on specific circumstances and the laws governing rent regulation in your area. Here's a general overview:\n\n**Rent stabilization laws:** In New York City, for example, rent-stabilized buildings are regulated by the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) and the Rent Control Law (RCL). These laws aim to provide affordable housing options by limiting annual rent increases.\n\n**Building-wide work:** When your landlord wants to perform building-wide work, such as replacing a boiler or installing new equipment, they may be able to raise your rent if:\n\n1. The work is necessary to maintain the building's integrity and safety.\n2. The landlord provides written notice to tenants, usually at least 30 days prior to starting the work.\n3. The increased rent is directly related to the cost of the project and not an excuse for a general rent hike.\n\n**Rent increase limits:** In New York City, if your landlord wants to raise your rent due to building-wide work, they can only increase your rent by:\n\n1. 4% to 6% per year, depending on the Rent Guidelines Board's (RGB) annual determination.\n2. The actual cost of the project, if it's deemed \"substantial\" and not just a minor repair.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n1. Review your lease agreement or rent-stabilization documents to understand your rights and obligations.\n2. Document any issues with the building or equipment before work begins, as this can help establish a connection between the work and the rent increase.\n3. Ask your landlord for written justification of the proposed rent increase, including estimates of costs and timelines.\n4. If you disagree with the proposed rent increase, consider hiring a lawyer to help navigate the process and advocate on your behalf.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. Be aware that building-wide work can sometimes be used as an excuse to raise rents unfairly. Keep records of any communication with your landlord regarding the project and its impact on your rent.\n2. If you're unsure about your situation, consult with a tenant lawyer or housing advocate for guidance specific to your case.\n\nRemember, while building-wide work may justify a rent increase, it's essential to understand your rights under rent-stabilization laws and ensure that any rent hike is reasonable and justified."

            "gemini-2.5-flash": "You're asking about Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs) in a rent-stabilized building in NYC. Since your building has **more than 35 apartments**, it falls under specific rules for IAI calculations.\n\nHere's how the permanent rent increase for an IAI is calculated in your situation:\n\n1.  **The Amortization Period:**\n    For buildings with **more than 35 apartments**, the landlord can add **1/180th** of the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost of the IAI to the monthly rent.\n    *   This means the monthly rent increase is calculated as: **(Total Cost of Approved IAI) / 180**\n\n    *(For comparison, in buildings with 35 or fewer apartments, the rate is 1/168th.)*\n\n2.  **What Qualifies as an IAI (Eligible Costs):**\n    To be eligible for a rent increase, the improvement must be a **permanent, physical betterment** to the apartment. It must:\n    *   Be new (not a repair or routine maintenance).\n    *   Add to the value of the apartment, not just restore it to its previous condition.\n    *   Be verifiable and reasonable in cost.\n\n    **Examples of eligible IAIs:**\n    *   Installation of new kitchen cabinets, countertops, or sinks.\n    *   Installation of new bathroom fixtures (toilet, sink, bathtub/shower).\n    *   Installation of new flooring (e.g., hardwood, tile, new wall-to-wall carpeting, not just refinishing existing floors).\n    *   Installation of new appliances (stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, air conditioner if permanently installed).\n    *   Installation of new windows or doors.\n    *   Significant electrical or plumbing upgrades.\n\n3.  **What Does NOT Qualify (Ineligible Costs):**\n    *   **Routine repairs:** Fixing a leaky faucet, patching a wall, replacing a broken light fixture.\n    *   **Cosmetic changes:** Painting, wallpapering, cleaning.\n    *   **Improvements for which the landlord has already been reimbursed:** Through insurance, tax abatements, or other government programs.\n    *   **Excessive or unreasonable costs:** The DHCR (Division of Housing and Community Renewal) can disallow costs it deems too high for the work performed.\n    *   **Improvements to common areas:** These are Major Capital Improvements (MCIs), which have a different calculation method.\n\n4.  **Important Caps on IAI Increases (Post-HSTPA 2019):**\n    The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) of 2019 significantly limited IAI increases:\n    *   **Total Cost Cap:** The total cost of IAIs that can be passed on to a tenant in any **15-year period** is capped at **$15,000**. Any costs above this amount cannot be used to calculate a rent increase.\n    *   **Monthly Rent Increase Cap:** The monthly rent increase resulting from an IAI cannot exceed **6% of the tenant's current rent** in any 12-month period. If the calculated 1/180th increase is more than 6% of the current rent, the landlord can only implement the 6% increase.\n\n5.  **Documentation Requirements:**\n    Landlords must maintain detailed records of all IAI work, including:\n    *   Invoices from contractors or suppliers.\n    *   Proof of payment (canceled checks, bank statements).\n    *   Before-and-after photographs of the apartment.\n    *   Contractor agreements.\n    These records must be provided to the tenant upon request and to the DHCR if the increase is challenged.\n\n6.  **When the Increase Applies:**\n    *   If the IAI work was done while the apartment was **vacant**, the increase applies to the next tenant's initial rent.\n    *   If the IAI work was done while the apartment was **occupied**, the tenant must have **consented in writing** to the work for the increase to apply to their rent.\n\n**In summary for your building (more than 35 apartments):**\n\nThe landlord can add **1/180th of the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost** of eligible improvements to the monthly rent, subject to a **$15,000 total cost cap** over 15 years and a **6% monthly rent increase cap** in any 12-month period.\n\nIf you believe an IAI increase is improper, excessive, or based on ineligible work, you have the right to request documentation from your landlord and, if unsatisfied, file a complaint with the NYS Homes and Community Renewal (DHCR).",
            "llama3": "A crucial question for many apartment dwellers!\n\nWhen a landlord undertakes an Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI), they are allowed to increase the rent of the affected unit(s) by the cost of the improvement, plus a reasonable return on investment. Here's how the calculation typically works:\n\n1. **Cost of Improvement**: This is the actual cost of making the improvements, including materials and labor.\n2. **Capitalization Rate**: The landlord's chosen rate to calculate the expected annual return on their investment. A common range is 4-8%, although this can vary depending on factors like market conditions, property type, and local economy.\n3. **Recovery Period**: This is the number of years it will take for the landlord to recover their initial investment through rent increases. Typically, this period ranges from 5-10 years.\n\nTo calculate the permanent rent increase:\n\n1. Divide the Cost of Improvement by the Recovery Period (e.g., $20,000 improvement / 7-year recovery period = $2,857 per year).\n2. Multiply the result by the chosen Capitalization Rate (e.g., $2,857 x 6% = $171.42).\n\nThe resulting figure is the maximum rent increase allowed for each affected unit. For example, if the landlord spent $20,000 on improvements and chose a 6% capitalization rate, the permanent rent increase could be approximately $171.42 per year.\n\nKeep in mind that these calculations may vary depending on your local jurisdiction's regulations and specific circumstances. It's always a good idea to review your lease agreement and consult with your landlord or an attorney if you have questions or concerns about the IAI calculation."
