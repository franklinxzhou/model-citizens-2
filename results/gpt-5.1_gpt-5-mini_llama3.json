            "gpt-5.1": "Yes. In New York, many landlord\u2011tenant laws apply **even if you only had a verbal/handshake agreement** and no written lease.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. **A verbal rental agreement is still a contract**  \n   - If you agreed on basics like the apartment, rent amount, and when rent is due, that\u2019s a valid tenancy under NY law.  \n   - A written lease is required only in some situations (for example, some rent\u2011stabilized units must have written leases), but basic tenant rights don\u2019t disappear just because it\u2019s verbal.\n\n2. **State law that applies to you (even without a written lease)**  \n   Important New York statutes include:\n   - **Real Property Law (RPL)** \u2013 e.g.:  \n     - RPL \u00a7 235\u2011b: \u201cWarranty of habitability\u201d (landlord must keep the place safe and livable).  \n     - RPL \u00a7 235\u2011c: Unconscionable lease or terms may be unenforceable.  \n     - RPL \u00a7 235\u2011e: Requirements for providing rent receipts in many situations.  \n   - **Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (RPAPL)** \u2013 governs court eviction procedures, notices, etc.  \n   - **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)** \u2013 expanded notice requirements, security deposit rules, late fee limits, and more.\n\n3. **Examples of protections you still have with a handshake deal**  \n   Even with no written lease, a landlord generally:\n   - **Must keep the apartment habitable** (heat, hot water, no dangerous conditions, etc.).  \n   - **Must follow legal eviction procedures** \u2013 they cannot lock you out, remove your door, shut off utilities, or throw out your belongings without a court order (that\u2019s an illegal \u201cself\u2011help\u201d eviction).  \n   - **Must give proper notice of termination or rent increases** (usually 30/60/90 days depending on how long you\u2019ve lived there, per HSTPA) for most month\u2011to\u2011month tenancies.  \n   - **Cannot charge more than one month\u2019s rent as a security deposit**, and must follow rules on returning it and giving an itemized list of deductions.  \n   - **Cannot charge excessive late fees** (generally capped at the lesser of $50 or 5% of monthly rent for residential tenancies).  \n\n4. **Month\u2011to\u2011month tenancies**  \n   With no written lease, your arrangement is often legally treated as **month\u2011to\u2011month**, especially if you pay monthly. New York law sets:\n   - How much notice is needed to end the tenancy.  \n   - How much notice is required for a rent increase (same time periods as ending the tenancy).\n\n5. **Local NYC rules also apply (if you\u2019re in NYC)**  \n   On top of state law, NYC has:\n   - **Housing Maintenance Code** and **NYC Administrative Code** requiring certain services and repairs.  \n   - Special rules if the apartment is **rent\u2011stabilized** or **rent\u2011controlled** (then there are additional protections, and usually a written lease is required).\n\nIf you tell me:\n- whether you\u2019re in NYC or elsewhere in NY, and  \n- roughly how long you\u2019ve lived there and how you pay rent (monthly, weekly),  \n\nI can walk you through exactly what type of tenancy you likely have and what notice/eviction rules apply in your situation.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Yes. New York law governs landlord\u2013tenant relationships even if you only had a handshake. An oral agreement can create a tenancy and many statutory and common\u2011law protections apply whether or not there is a written lease.\n\nKey points to know\n- Oral agreements are valid for most residential tenancies. The Statute of Frauds requires a writing only for leases longer than one year. So a handshake that results in you living there and paying rent will normally create a tenancy (often a month\u2011to\u2011month or tenancy at will).\n- Implied warranty of habitability. Landlords must provide safe, livable housing (heat, hot water, no serious code violations). This duty applies regardless of whether the lease is written.\n- Evictions and self\u2011help. Landlords generally cannot use \u201cself\u2011help\u201d (changing locks, removing your belongings, shutting off utilities) to remove you. To evict you legally they must sue in Housing Court and follow the statutory process.\n- Notice and termination. Notice periods and rules for terminating tenancy depend on the type and length of the tenancy (fixed-term lease vs. month\u2011to\u2011month vs. tenancy at will). Those statutory notice rules apply whether the agreement was oral or written.\n- Security deposits and accounting. State and city rules limit how deposits are handled and require accounting for deductions; you have rights to get your deposit back or challenge unlawful deductions.\n- Rent regulation and local rules. If the unit is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled, additional protections and notice/renewal rules apply regardless of whether the lease was oral. New York City also enforces the Housing Maintenance Code, Multiple Dwelling Law, and local tenant\u2011protection ordinances.\n- No discrimination or retaliation. State and city human\u2011rights laws prohibit discrimination and prohibit landlord retaliation for requesting repairs or asserting tenant rights.\n\nPractical steps\n- Get the terms in writing ASAP (who lives there, rent amount, due date, any utilities included, length or whether month\u2011to\u2011month).\n- Keep records: rent receipts, cancelled checks, bank transfers, texts/emails, photos of the apartment and any problems, repair requests.\n- If the landlord isn\u2019t making repairs, report dangerous conditions to 311/NYC HPD and keep copies of complaints.\n- If you face eviction or the landlord uses self\u2011help, contact Legal Aid, a tenant advocacy group, or a housing attorney right away. Don\u2019t move out just because the landlord threatens you.\n- If you took or were charged a security deposit and the landlord won\u2019t return it, you may have a claim in court.\n\nWhere to get help\n- NYC Housing Court (for eviction/summary proceedings)\n- NYC 311 and HPD (for housing code violations and complaints)\n- Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, and tenant clinics/advocacy groups for free or low\u2011cost legal help\n\nIf you want, tell me more about your situation (how long you\u2019ve lived there, rent payments, any written messages, repairs needed, whether the landlord is trying to evict) and I can suggest the most relevant steps and notice periods to watch for.",
            "llama3": "In New York State, the answer is yes. Even if you don't have a written lease or formal agreement, the laws governing landlord-tenant relationships still apply.\n\nNew York State has several laws and regulations that protect tenants' rights, including:\n\n1. **The New York State Multiple Dwelling Law** (RPL 282): This law applies to most residential rental properties with three or more units.\n2. **The New York City Rent Regulation and Control Act** (RRL \u00a726-525): This law governs rent-stabilized apartments in NYC, which accounts for about half of the city's rentals.\n\nThese laws cover important aspects of landlord-tenant relationships, such as:\n\n* Security deposits\n* Rent increases\n* Evictions\n* Repairs and maintenance\n* Tenant screening\n\nIn New York State, a \"handshake deal\" or verbal agreement between a landlord and tenant is not considered a legally binding contract. However, even without a written lease, the laws mentioned above still apply to regulate the landlord-tenant relationship.\n\nIf you're a tenant in New York State, it's essential to understand your rights and responsibilities under these laws. You can find more information on the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) website or consult with an attorney if you have specific questions or concerns.\n\nAs a general rule, it's always recommended to put important agreements in writing to avoid misunderstandings and protect both parties' interests."

            "gpt-5.1": "To figure out if your NYC apartment is rent regulated (rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled) or unregulated, go through these steps:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Check the basic clues\n\nThese are not definitive, but they\u2019re good initial indicators.\n\n### A. Building size and age\nRent stabilization usually applies if:\n\n- The building has **6 or more residential units**, and  \n- It was built **before Jan 1, 1974**, and  \n- It has **not** been substantially rehabilitated as luxury housing or otherwise deregulated.\n\nAlso covered: many buildings that got certain tax benefits (e.g., **421\u2011a, J\u201151**) built after 1974, for the period of the tax benefit.\n\nRent control:\n- Applies to certain apartments in buildings built **before Feb 1, 1947**, where the tenant (or qualifying family member) has lived **continuously since before July 1, 1971**.\n- Very rare now; most regulated units today are rent\u2011stabilized.\n\nYou can look up year built and number of units using:\n- NYC Department of Buildings \u201cBuilding Information Search\u201d (BIS or DOB NOW)\n- NYC Department of Finance \u201cProperty Search\u201d (for units and sometimes tax benefits)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Look at your lease and riders\n\nSigns of rent stabilization:\n\n- Lease is typically a **Rent Stabilization Lease Rider** or comes with one.\n- Lease terms must be **1 or 2 years** (your choice at renewal).\n- The rent-stabilization rider often:\n  - Lists prior rents\n  - States \u201cthis apartment is rent\u2011stabilized\u201d\n  - References the **Rent Stabilization Code** or **DHCR** (NYS Homes and Community Renewal).\n\nIf your lease:\n- Has no rider,\n- Doesn\u2019t mention rent stabilization, and\n- Gives unusual terms like 3\u2011year, 18\u2011month, or month\u2011to\u2011month starting out,  \nit is more likely unregulated\u2014but lack of a rider does **not** prove that. Landlords sometimes fail to provide required riders.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Request the rent history from DHCR\n\nThis is the most important and authoritative step.\n\n**DHCR (NYS Homes and Community Renewal)** maintains official rent histories for rent\u2011stabilized apartments.\n\nYou can request a rent history:\n- Online: search \u201cNYS HCR rent history request\u201d\n- By mail or in person at a DHCR borough office\n- By phone: DHCR info line\n\nNotes:\n- **Only a current tenant, former tenant, or owner can get it** (you can\u2019t pull it for someone else\u2019s apartment).\n- The printout will show:\n  - Whether the unit is registered as rent stabilized\n  - Legal regulated rent vs. what you pay\n  - Registration each year back to about 1984\n\nIf DHCR has no record, the landlord may not be registering (which can be illegal), or the unit may truly be unregulated. The history must be interpreted carefully, especially if rents suddenly jump or registration stops.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Check for tax benefits (421\u2011a, J\u201151, etc.)\n\nSome buildings are rent\u2011stabilized **because** they receive tax abatements, even if they\u2019re newer or would otherwise be market\u2011rate.\n\nUse:\n- NYC Department of Finance \u201cProperty Tax Bill\u201d or \u201cBenefits\u201d lookup\n- HPD\u2019s \u201cBuilding, Registration & Ownership\u201d search\n\nIf you see programs like **421\u2011a, J\u201151**, or similar, the apartments may be required to be rent\u2011stabilized during the benefit period. In those cases, landlords still must:\n- Register rents with DHCR\n- Provide rent\u2011stabilization riders\n- Follow rent\u2011stabilization rules\n\n---\n\n## 5. Look for the typical legal protections / patterns\n\nYou are likely rent\u2011stabilized if most of the following are true:\n\n- Building has **6+ units**, built before 1974, or has tax benefits.\n- You get **renewal leases automatically** (you\u2019re offered renewal, not told to leave at term end).\n- Rent increases roughly match **Rent Guidelines Board** percentages each year.\n- There\u2019s a DHCR rent history showing your unit as \u201cstabilized.\u201d\n\nYou are likely unregulated (market\u2011rate/\u201cfree market\u201d) if:\n\n- Building has **fewer than 6 units**, or\n- It\u2019s a newer building with **no applicable tax benefit**, and\n- No DHCR rent history exists, and\n- Your rent and lease terms are set freely by the landlord, without reference to RGB guidelines.\n\nBut \u201clikely\u201d is not the same as legally certain\u2014many apartments are misclassified.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Be aware of illegal deregulation or improper claims\n\nAfter 2019\u2019s Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act, many prior deregulations were limited or eliminated, and some units that were improperly deregulated can still be treated as rent\u2011stabilized by the courts.\n\nRed flags:\n- Large unexplained jumps in the DHCR rent history.\n- A sudden stop in registration.\n- Landlord insisting \u201cthis used to be stabilized, but now it\u2019s luxury deregulated,\u201d for tenancies that began **after June 14, 2019** (high\u2011rent vacancy deregulation is no longer allowed for new deregulations).\n\nIf you see this, speak to a tenant lawyer or a tenant advocacy group.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Where to get help interpreting what you find\n\n- **DHCR**: for rent history and general information\n- **Tenant organizations**:  \n  - Met Council on Housing  \n  - Legal Aid Society / Legal Services NYC / Legal Aid\u2013affiliated tenant units\n- **Bar Association referral**: for a tenant\u2011side housing attorney\n\nThey can:\n- Review your DHCR printout\n- Compare your rent with legal regulated rent\n- Help you argue that you\u2019re rent\u2011stabilized if the landlord disputes it\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Your building\u2019s approximate year of construction\n- Number of units\n- Whether you\u2019ve ever received a DHCR rider or rent history\nI can walk you through how likely it is that you\u2019re rent\u2011regulated and suggest your next specific steps.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: you confirm it by checking the lease for a rent-stabilization rider and by getting the apartment\u2019s rent history/registration from NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) or from NYC property records. Below are the quick tests and concrete steps.\n\nWhat \u201crent regulated\u201d means in NYC\n- Rent-stabilized: most common in NYC. Generally covers apartments in buildings with 6+ units built between Feb. 1, 1947 and Dec. 31, 1973, and apartments in buildings of any age that received certain tax/subsidy benefits (e.g., J\u201151, 421\u2011a/421\u2011g, Section 8). Rent-stabilized units have a legal regulated rent, renewal offer rules and limits on increases set by the Rent Guidelines Board.\n- Rent-controlled: rare now. Applies only to tenants (or their lawful successors) who have been in continuous occupancy since before July 1, 1971, in certain very old buildings (built before Feb. 1, 1947). Rent control has different rules and usually a much lower legal rent.\n- Unregulated/\u201cmarket rate\u201d: usually apartments in small buildings (fewer than 6 units), buildings built after 1974, or units not subject to any subsidy or stabilization program.\n\nConcrete steps to find out\n\n1. Look at your lease and renewal offer\n- Rent-stabilized leases must include a \u201cRent Stabilization Rider\u201d and the landlord usually provides a lease renewal with the legal regulated rent and the Rent Guidelines Board increase. If the lease or renewal explicitly says \u201crent-stabilized\u201d (or includes the rider) it\u2019s a clear sign.\n\n2. Ask your landlord in writing\n- Request proof of regulatory status (e.g., DHCR registration number or last legal regulated rent; whether the building receives any tax/subsidy benefits). Save the request and the reply.\n\n3. Get the rent history / registration from DHCR\n- Request a rent history or registration from the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). The rent history shows whether the apartment has been registered as rent-stabilized and the legal regulated rent history. If it\u2019s rent-stabilized, the DHCR rent history will show that. (Visit DHCR\u2019s website or contact them for the rent history request process.)\n\n4. Check NYC property records\n- Use HPD, ACRIS or DOB property records to confirm year built, number of units and any tax abatements/subsidies. If the building was built between 1947\u20131973 and has 6+ units, it\u2019s likely subject to rent stabilization unless it is a condo/co-op that was carved out of stabilization or otherwise exempt.\n\n5. Look for signs in practice\n- If the landlord gives you a formal renewal notice tied to the Rent Guidelines Board schedule, issues \u201covercharge\u201d/preferential rent language, or the rent has been registered with DHCR, those are signs of rent stabilization.\n- If the lease calls the unit \u201cmarket rate,\u201d there is no stabilization rider, the building is small or built after 1974 and there are no subsidy programs, it is likely unregulated.\n\nImportant legal points to know\n- Rent control is very limited: only for tenants (or their lawful successors) in continuous occupancy since before July 1, 1971, in eligible older buildings.\n- The 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act removed prior vacancy/high\u2011rent decontrol rules, so many prior paths to decontrol no longer apply.\n- Landlords must register rent-stabilized units annually with the state; tenants can and should request the rent history or registration to confirm status.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short written request to your landlord asking for proof of regulatory status,\n- Tell you how to request a rent-history from DHCR (sample wording and what to include),\n- Or walk through checking a specific building (if you give the address, I can list likely sources to check). Which would you prefer?",
            "llama3": "In New York City, rent regulation status can be a crucial factor in determining the rent you pay and your rights as a tenant. Here's how to determine whether your New York apartment is rent regulated or unregulated:\n\n**Rent Regulated Apartments:**\n\n1. **Look for a Rent Regulation Agreement (RRA)**: Check your lease or rental agreement. If it mentions an RRA, your apartment is likely rent regulated.\n2. **Check with the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)**: HPD maintains a database of rent-regulated apartments. You can search their website for information on your building or use their Rent Regulation Search Tool.\n\n**Unregulated Apartments:**\n\n1. **Check if your apartment is an \"Owner-Occupied\" Building**: If your building has fewer than six units and the landlord occupies one of those units, it's likely unregulated.\n2. **Verify with the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB)**: The DOB maintains records on building permits and licenses. You can check their website to see if your building is registered as a rent-regulated or non-rent-regulated property.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* If you're unsure about the rent regulation status, contact your landlord or property manager directly.\n* Keep in mind that some apartments may be partially regulated (e.g., under Rent Stabilization) and others might be completely unregulated (e.g., under the Loft Law).\n* Even if your apartment is not rent regulated, it may still be subject to other protections and laws, such as security deposits or notice requirements.\n\nRemember to always review your lease or rental agreement carefully before signing, and don't hesitate to seek legal advice if you have questions or concerns about your apartment's rent regulation status."

In NYC, *rent control* applies to **individual apartments**, not entire buildings, but these checks will tell you if rent control is even plausible:\n\n1. **Building age (crucial)**  \n   - The apartment must be in a building that:\n     - Is a **1\u20132 family home built before 1947**, *or*\n     - Is a **3+ unit building built before 1947** that has been continuously occupied by the same tenant (or that tenant\u2019s lawful successor) since **before July 1, 1971**.  \n   - If your building was built **1950s, 1960s, 1970s or later**, it\u2019s **not** rent controlled (though it might be rent-stabilized).\n\n2. **Number of units (basic filter)**  \n   - Rent-controlled apartments are more often found in **pre-1947 multi-unit buildings**.\n   - A single-family house or condo unit is very unlikely to be rent controlled unless it\u2019s a very old 1\u20132 family home with the same tenant (or family successor) there since before 1971.\n\n3. **How long has the current household lived there?**  \n   - Rent control almost always involves people (or their family successors) who have been in the apartment for **decades**.\n   - If:\n     - The current tenant moved in **after July 1, 1971**, that apartment **cannot** be rent controlled.\n   - If someone has been there since the 1960s/early 1970s and never lost primary residence, it might be rent controlled.\n\n4. **Look up the building on HPD & DOB**  \n   These won\u2019t say \u201crent controlled,\u201d but they help you check age and type.  \n   - **NYC HPD \u201cHPD Online\u201d** (via NYC HPD website):  \n     - Shows building registration, year built, number of units.  \n   - **NYC DOB \u201cBuilding Information System\u201d (BIS) or DOB NOW**:  \n     - Confirms the building\u2019s **year built** and occupancy details.  \n   If the year built is **1947 or later**, you can rule out rent control entirely.\n\n5. **Check with DHCR (state agency that regulates rent laws)**  \n   The only definitive check is through **NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR)**:\n   - You (as tenant) can **request the apartment\u2019s rent history** (online or by mail). That record will usually show if it\u2019s registered as rent-controlled or rent-stabilized.\n   - Phone: NYS HCR Rent Info Line (you can search \u201cNYS HCR rent info line\u201d for the current number).  \n\n6. **Quick yes/no checklist**  \n   Your apartment **might be rent controlled** only if ALL of these are true:\n   - Building built **before 1947**, and  \n   - Apartment has been occupied **continuously since before July 1, 1971** by the same tenant or a qualified family successor, and  \n   - The tenant uses it as their **primary residence** in NYC, and  \n   - It\u2019s not a co-op/condo unit that\u2019s been exempted or otherwise deregulated.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The **address**,  \n- Approximate **year built** (if you know), and  \n- Roughly how long the current household has lived there,  \n\nI can walk you through, step-by-step, whether rent control is realistically possible for your unit and what to do next to confirm it.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: yes \u2014 there\u2019s a pretty quick checklist you can run through, and the definitive answer is in the rent history records kept by New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR).\n\nFast checklist (if all three are true, the apartment might be rent\u2011controlled)\n- Building age: the building was built before February 1947.  \n- Tenant occupancy: the tenant (or an eligible successor) has lived continuously in that apartment since before July 1, 1971.  \n- The apartment hasn\u2019t been permanently removed from control by a documented change (vacancy/transfer/conversion) since then.\n\nHow to check quickly\n1. Find the building\u2019s year-built: use the NYC Department of Buildings property search or the Department of Finance property page (enter the address). If it was built after 1947, it will not be rent\u2011controlled.  \n2. Check your move\u2011in date (and prior tenant history): rent control requires continuous occupancy since before July 1, 1971. Look for old leases, rent receipts, utility bills, voter registration, or other proof of long-term occupancy.  \n3. Look at your lease or any landlord paperwork \u2014 a rent\u2011controlled lease often will say \u201crent controlled,\u201d but landlords sometimes omit it.  \n4. Get the definitive record from HCR: request the rent history for your unit (HCR\u2019s online services or request form). The HCR rent history will show whether the unit is listed as \u201crent controlled\u201d or \u201crent stabilized,\u201d and list past rents and status changes.\n\nWhere to get help and records\n- New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) is the official source. Search \u201cHCR rent history\u201d or go to hcr.ny.gov and request the rent history for your address/unit.  \n- If you prefer, you can ask the landlord in writing for a copy of the rent history/registration or contact a local legal aid/tenant organization for assistance.\n\nA few extra points\n- Rent\u2011controlled apartments are now rare in NYC because the rules are narrow. Most regulated apartments today are rent\u2011stabilized (different rules).  \n- If the controlling tenant left the apartment decades ago, the unit\u2019s status may have changed; that\u2019s why checking HCR records is important.  \n- Succession rules can preserve control for family members who\u2019ve lived in the unit continuously and meet statutory requirements.\n\nIf you want, tell me the building address and the date you (or the prior tenant) started living there and I can walk you through the next concrete steps to look up the rent history.",
            "llama3": "In many jurisdictions, buildings built before a certain date or with certain characteristics are subject to rent control regulations. Here's a simplified guide to help you determine if your building might be under rent control:\n\n1. **Check the age of the building**: In New York City, for example, buildings constructed before 1947 are generally subject to rent control. In San Francisco, it's buildings built before 1920.\n2. **Research local laws and regulations**: Look up the rent control laws specific to your city or state. You can start by searching online for \"rent control [your city/state]\" or consulting with a real estate attorney or property management professional.\n3. **Check if the building has been declared an historic landmark**: If the building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it may be subject to rent control or other preservation regulations.\n4. **Examine the building's construction and architecture**: Buildings with unique architectural features, such as ornate details or antique elevators, might be more likely to be under rent control.\n5. **Consult with your landlord or property manager**: They should have access to information about the building's history and any applicable rent control regulations.\n\nSome common characteristics of buildings subject to rent control include:\n\n* Older buildings (pre-1940s in some cities)\n* Buildings listed on historic registers\n* Unique architectural features\n* Rent-controlled apartments or studios with low rent increases\n\nKeep in mind that even if your building is under rent control, individual units may have different regulations and rent increase schedules. If you're unsure about the specifics of your building's rent control status, consult with a real estate expert or local authorities for guidance."

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **New York City**: The Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 regulates rents for apartments in NYC, which is divided into two zones:\n\t* **Rent-Stabilized Apartments** (RSAs): Approximately 2 million units are rent-stabilized, which means annual rent increases are capped at 3-6% depending on the zone.\n\t* **Rent-Controlled Apartments** (RCAs): Only about 120,000 apartments remain under rent control, with a maximum annual increase of 4%.\n2. **Other parts of New York State**: While there may be local rent control laws or regulations in other areas of the state, these are typically less comprehensive and not as well-established as those in NYC.\n\nSome notable exceptions include:\n\n* **Westchester County** (just north of NYC): Some municipalities within Westchester have their own rent regulation laws.\n* **Long Island** (Nassau and Suffolk counties): There may be local rent control or stabilization measures in place, but these are not uniform across the entire region.\n\nKeep in mind that even where rent control is still applicable, there might be exceptions, exemptions, or loopholes. The specifics of rent control and stabilization can vary depending on the location, property type, tenant-landlord agreements, and other factors.\n\nTo determine if a specific apartment or building is under rent control or stabilization, it's best to research the local laws, consult with a real estate expert or attorney, or review publicly available records from the relevant government agencies."

            "llama3": "The magic of rent control! In New York City, rent stabilization and rent control laws are complex, but I'll try to break it down for you.\n\n**Rent Control:**\nIn NYC, rent control applies only to apartments that were built before October 1974. To qualify for rent control, you would need to have lived in your apartment since at least June 27, 1943, when the Rent Regulation Reform Act was enacted.\n\nHowever, this is rare, as most apartments were built after the war, and many pre-war buildings have been demolished or redeveloped over time. If you're lucky enough to live in a pre-1974 building, you might be eligible for rent control.\n\n**Rent Stabilization:**\nRent stabilization applies to apartments that were built between October 1974 and January 1997. To qualify for rent stabilization, you would need to have lived in your apartment since at least January 1, 1993.\n\nIf you've been a tenant for less than four years, your apartment is likely subject to the vacancy rate, which means your rent can increase by up to 20% when you renew your lease. However, after four years, your apartment becomes stabilized, and your rent increases are capped at 2% per year (or 18% over two years).\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. Rent control applies only to pre-October 1974 buildings.\n2. Rent stabilization applies to apartments built between October 1974 and January 1997.\n3. To qualify for rent control or stabilization, you typically need to have lived in your apartment since the applicable date.\n\nKeep in mind that these rules are subject to change, and specific circumstances may affect your eligibility.

A qualifying successor (for example a spouse or family member who lawfully succeeds to the tenancy) can keep the apartment rent\u2011controlled.\n- If the controlled tenant dies or moves out and there is no lawful successor, the unit typically loses rent\u2011control status on vacancy. It does not automatically remain rent\u2011controlled for the next tenant.\n- What happens next depends on the building and facts: the unit might become market\u2011rate or, depending on building coverage and other rules, rent\u2011stabilized. Different rules apply for temporary absence, subtenants, or short\u2011term moves.\n- Landlords must register unit status with NYS DHCR; that office can confirm whether a unit is still rent\u2011controlled.\n\nIf you have a particular apartment or set of facts (tenant died, moved to a nursing home, a family member moved in, etc.), tell me the details and I can explain how the rules likely apply and what steps to take (checking DHCR records, filing a succession claim, or consulting a tenant attorney).",
            "llama3": "In New York City, when a rent-controlled tenant moves out, the apartment is not automatically converted to rent-stabilized or market-rate. Instead, the landlord has some options:\n\n1. **Vacancy Lease**: The landlord can offer a new lease at the current stabilized rent (which may be higher than the original rent-controlled rent). This is known as a \"vacancy lease.\" If the landlord does this, the new tenant becomes a rent-stabilized tenant.\n2. **Market Rent**: The landlord can choose to rent the apartment at market rate. In this case, the new tenant would pay whatever the going rate for a similar apartment in the same building is.\n3. **Rent-Stabilization**: If the landlord wants to keep the apartment stabilized (i.e., regulated by the Rent Stabilization Code), they must file an application with the New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) within 30 days of the tenant's vacancy. The HPD will review the application to determine if the apartment is eligible for rent stabilization.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* If the landlord offers a new lease at the current stabilized rent, the next tenant becomes a rent-stabilized tenant.\n* If the landlord rents the apartment at market rate, there is no regulation on the rent.\n* If the landlord files an application to keep the apartment stabilized, the HPD will review it, and if approved, the next tenant would become a rent-stabilized tenant.\n\nKeep in mind that these options may vary depending on the specific circumstances of your building and the New York City Rent Guidelines Board's rules.

But you still need to confirm because many units have been deregulated over the years or may never have been stabilized (e.g., certain owner-occupied small buildings, certain coops/condos, some improperly deregulated units, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### How to check if *your* apartment is rent stabilized\n\n1. **Request your rent history from NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DSCR)**\n   - You can:\n     - Call: **718-739-6400**, or  \n     - Use the online portal: search \u201cNYS rent stabilized rent history request\u201d.\n   - Ask for the **\u201centire rent history\u201d** for your apartment, not just recent years.\n   - If the history shows \u201cRS\u201d or \u201cRent Stabilized\u201d and legal regulated rents, that\u2019s a strong sign it\u2019s stabilized (even if the landlord claims otherwise).\n\n2. **Search the NYC Tax Bills / Property Info**\n   - Go to **NYC Department of Finance \u2013 \u201cProperty Portal\u201d or \u201cACRIS/Property Tax Bills\u201d**.\n   - Look up your building\u2019s address.  \n   - Many rent-stabilized buildings get a **J-51** or **421-a** tax benefit; if your building currently has or recently had one, that often means units are or were required to be rent stabilized during the benefit period.\n\n3. **Check clues in your lease and how your rent changes**\n   - A rent-stabilized lease should:\n     - Be for **1 or 2 years**, at **your choice**; and  \n     - Include a **Rent Stabilization Rider** explaining your rights and legal rent.\n   - Legal rent increases should match **Rent Guidelines Board (RGB)** percentages, not arbitrary amounts.\n\n4. **Talk to a local tenants\u2019 organization or legal service**\n   - Groups like:\n     - **Legal Aid Society**, **Legal Services NYC**, **Mobilization for Justice**, **Housing Court Answers**, local **tenant unions**.\n   - They can look at your documents and confirm whether your landlord is complying with rent stabilization rules.\n\n---\n\n### Important nuance\n\nEven if HCR doesn\u2019t show your apartment as stabilized, that **doesn\u2019t always mean it isn\u2019t**. Many landlords illegally failed to register units or deregulated them improperly. Courts have restored apartments to rent-stabilized status, especially after the **2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA)**. That\u2019s why a full rent history plus legal advice is important if something looks off (e.g., huge unexplained rent jumps or a gap in registrations).\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether your lease is 1 or 2 years,\n- Whether you got a rent stabilization rider,\n- How your rent increases have been calculated,\n\nI can give you a more tailored assessment of how likely it is that your particular unit is stabilized and what next step makes the most sense.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: very likely, but not guaranteed.\n\nWhy: Under New York State rent-stabilization rules, most NYC apartment buildings with six or more units that were built between Feb. 1, 1947 and 1974 are subject to rent stabilization. Your building (1960, 10 units) therefore would usually fall within that category.\n\nImportant exceptions and caveats\n- Some buildings are exempt or have different rules (for example, certain co-op/condo conversions or owner-occupied small multi\u2011family conversions).\n- Buildings of any age can be subject to rent stabilization if they receive certain tax benefits or financing (J\u201151, 421\u2011a/now 421\u2011a successors, Mitchell\u2011Lama, etc.).\n- Some individual apartments were deregulated in the past under old rules (vacancy or high\u2011rent/high\u2011income deregulation). The 2019 changes to the rent laws eliminated future high\u2011rent/high\u2011income deregulation, but units that were deregulated before may remain so unless successfully challenged.\n- Substantial building conversions, changes in use, or certain legal transactions can alter status.\n\nHow to confirm for your apartment (recommended steps)\n1. Check your lease: rent-stabilized leases usually include a \u201cRent Stabilization Rider\u201d and language about lease renewal rights and DHCR/HCR.\n2. Ask your landlord in writing whether the apartment is rent stabilized and request the rent history/registration.\n3. Request the rent history from NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). HCR can provide official rent history and registration status.\n4. Check NYC HPD/HCR databases or call 311 for basic building registration information.\n5. If you suspect misclassification, you can file a grievance with HCR/DHCR or contact a tenant legal services provider (Legal Aid, city bar, tenant union) or housing court attorney.\n\nIf you want, tell me the borough and the street address and I can point you to the right city/state lookup or draft a short written request to your landlord asking for rent-stabilization proof.",
            "llama3": "Not necessarily. Rent stabilization laws are complex and depend on various factors, including the date of construction, the type of building, and local regulations.\n\nIn New York City, rent stabilization laws were enacted in 1969 (Local Law 14) and 1971 (Rent Stabilization Code). These laws aimed to control rapid rent increases and provide affordable housing options for tenants. To be considered rent-stabilized, your apartment must meet certain criteria:\n\n1. The building must have been constructed before July 1, 1974.\n2. The building must have six or more units.\n3. The building must be a multiple-dwelling building (a building with multiple apartments).\n\nIf your building meets these criteria and was built in 1960, it's possible that some or all of the apartments are rent-stabilized. However, to confirm, you should:\n\n1. Check your lease agreement: Look for language stating that your apartment is subject to rent stabilization.\n2. Contact the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD): You can request information about your building's rental status by contacting HPD or visiting their website.\n3. Consult with a housing lawyer: A qualified attorney specializing in landlord-tenant law can review your situation and provide guidance on your rights as a tenant.\n\nKeep in mind that even if some apartments in the building are rent-stabilized, not all units may be subject to these regulations."

            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Generally no.\n\nWhy: Under NYC law, \u201crent control\u201d applies to apartments in buildings built before Feb. 1, 1947 where the tenant (or a lawful successor) has been in continuous occupancy since before July 1, 1971. Apartments first occupied after June 30, 1971 in pre\u20111947 buildings cannot be rent\u2011controlled. Rent stabilization, on the other hand, typically covers a different group of buildings (most commonly buildings with six or more units built between Feb. 1, 1947 and Dec. 31, 1973, and buildings subject to certain tax or regulatory programs).\n\nSo an apartment in a pre\u20111947 building that was first occupied after 1971 will not be rent\u2011stabilized just because of the building\u2019s age. It can only be stabilized if the building/apartment is otherwise subject to a program or regulatory agreement that requires stabilization (examples: certain J\u201151, 421\u2011a or other tax/loan programs or specific regulatory commitments), or if there is some other unusual status documented in the building\u2019s registration.\n\nHow to check:\n- Request the apartment\u2019s rent history from New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR, formerly DHCR). The rent history shows whether the unit has ever been registered as rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled.\n- Ask the landlord for the building\u2019s rent\u2011stabilization registration or the regulatory agreement that imposes stabilization.\n- If you want, I can draft a rent\u2011history request or tell you where to submit it.\n\nIf you give the building address and unit, I can guide you through the rent\u2011history request or check likely coverage sources.",
            "llama3": "A great question about NYC rent regulation!\n\nIn New York City, rent stabilization laws changed significantly in 1971. Prior to then, apartments were governed by the old Rent Law of 1929, which allowed for more flexibility in setting rents.\n\nTo answer your question: yes, a pre-1947 building where you moved into an apartment after 1971 can generally be considered rent-stabilized. Here's why:\n\n1. **Pre-1947 buildings**: These apartments were governed by the old Rent Law of 1929, which allowed for more flexibility in setting rents.\n2. **Rent stabilization laws changed in 1971**: The New York City Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (effective January 15, 1971) introduced a new framework for regulating rents in stabilized apartments. This law applied to all rent-stabilized apartments existing at that time.\n3. **Apartment was vacant on or after February 1, 1971**: Since you moved into the apartment after 1971, it means the apartment was vacant when the new Rent Stabilization Law took effect.\n\nAssuming your lease started on or after February 1, 1971, and you're a rent-stabilized tenant, your rent will be regulated by the New York City Rent Stabilization Code. This means:\n\n* Your landlord must file an annual rent increase with the New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) department.\n* The maximum allowable rent increase is capped at 18% over two years or a percentage based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n* You have certain rights as a tenant, such as the ability to renew your lease or seek a vacancy increase.\n\nKeep in mind that there may be specific circumstances that affect your apartment's rent stabilization status.

(Less common situations)**  \n   The fact of vacancy itself doesn\u2019t deregulate, but other legal events *might* change the status, for example:\n   - **Expiry of certain regulatory agreements** (e.g., some tax benefit programs like old J\u201151 or 421\u2011a, depending on the building\u2019s history and court decisions like *Roberts* and *Casey*). Even here, status is heavily fact-specific, and many units must remain stabilized.  \n   - **Co-op/condo conversion**: Even then, non-purchasing tenants often keep rent-stabilization protections; vacant units may convert to non-stabilized, but that depends on the specific plan, timing, and building history.  \n   - **New construction outside the stabilization system**: If a building was never rent-stabilized to begin with, vacancy doesn\u2019t matter; but that\u2019s different from a currently stabilized unit.\n\n4. **What you can do right now**  \n   - Check your apartment\u2019s status through DHCR:\n     - Call DHCR\u2019s Rent Info Line or file a \u201cRent History\u201d request to see how the unit has been registered and if it is listed as rent-stabilized.  \n   - If a landlord claims the unit is suddenly \u201cfree market\u201d because it\u2019s vacant, that is very likely **illegal** under current law.  \n   - If the owner is trying to deregulate, you can:\n     - File a complaint with DHCR (e.g., \u201cRent Overcharge\u201d or \u201cFailure to Register\u201d if they\u2019re not registering it as stabilized).  \n     - Consult a tenant lawyer or a tenants\u2019 rights organization for case-specific advice.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- the building size (number of apartments),  \n- approximate construction year,  \n- whether the building gets tax benefits (421\u2011a, J\u201151, etc.), and  \n- your most recent legal rent,  \n\nI can give a more tailored view of how secure the rent-stabilized status is in your specific situation.",

High-rent / high-income deregulation was abolished in 2019\nBefore June 14, 2019, a rent\u2011stabilized apartment could be deregulated if:\n- The legal regulated rent was above a certain threshold, **and**\n- The tenant\u2019s income was above a certain threshold for two consecutive years.\n\nThis was called \u201chigh\u2011rent/high\u2011income deregulation\u201d or \u201cluxury decontrol.\u201d\n\nThe **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)** eliminated this. Under current law:\n- **No new deregulations** based on rent level or tenant income are allowed.\n- A rent-stabilized apartment generally remains stabilized **as long as it\u2019s still used as a primary residence** and is not otherwise lawfully deregulated.\n\n### 2. What if your landlord claims you\u2019re \u201cderegulated\u201d now?\nLandlords sometimes still send letters or offer \u201cmarket-rate\u201d renewals claiming:\n- \u201cYour rent is over $2,774.76 / $2,700 / etc., so the unit is deregulated,\u201d or\n- \u201cYour income disqualifies you from rent stabilization.\u201d\n\nThose claims are almost certainly **wrong if the alleged deregulation would occur after June 14, 2019**. The landlord must:\n- Continue to offer **rent-stabilized renewal leases**, and  \n- Continue to register the apartment with **DHCR** as stabilized, unless there was a **lawful deregulation before 6/14/2019**.\n\n### 3. The main exception: deregulation that happened *before* June 14, 2019\nIf:\n- Your apartment was **already lawfully deregulated** before June 14, 2019 (through high\u2011rent/high\u2011income or high-rent vacancy deregulation), **and**\n- That deregulation was legal under the law in effect at that time,\n\nthen HSTPA doesn\u2019t automatically re\u2011stabilize it. However, many \u201cluxury deregulations\u201d from the past are now being challenged as **improper** (for example, improperly calculated rents, illegal improvements, or fraud).\n\nIf:\n- Your landlord claims the unit was deregulated years ago, and\n- You were never given proper rent histories or DHCR riders,\n\nit might still be possible to argue that the apartment **should still be rent-stabilized**.\n\n### 4. Your apartment type matters\nThis answer assumes a **standard rent-stabilized apartment**. Different rules may apply if:\n- It\u2019s a **NYC Housing Authority** (NYCHA) apartment,\n- It\u2019s a **Mitchell-Lama**, 421\u2011a, J\u201151, or other tax-benefit building, or\n- It\u2019s **rent-controlled** (older system).\n\nSome program rules can involve income, but they\u2019re **not** the same as the old luxury deregulation laws.\n\n### 5. What you can do right now\nTo check your status and protect yourself:\n\n1. **Get your rent history from DHCR**  \n   - Call DHCR (NYS Homes and Community Renewal): 718\u2011739\u20116400  \n   - Or request online: \u201cDHCR rent history request\u201d (you\u2019ll need your address and name on the lease).  \n   - This shows how the landlord has been registering the unit.\n\n2. **Check your lease and riders**  \n   - If your lease or rider says \u201cRent Stabilization Rider\u201d or references Rent Stabilization Code, that\u2019s strong evidence your unit is stabilized.\n   - If your landlord is suddenly saying it\u2019s not stabilized, compare that to what\u2019s in your prior leases.\n\n3. **If your landlord is trying to raise your rent to \u2018market\u2019 or deny a stabilized renewal**:  \n   - You can file an **\u201cRA-90 Tenant\u2019s Complaint of Owner\u2019s Failure to Renew Lease and/or Failure to Furnish a Copy of a Signed Lease\u201d** with DHCR.  \n   - Or, if they\u2019ve deregulated you illegally, you can file an overcharge / status complaint.\n\n4. **Get legal help if you\u2019re unsure**  \n   - Call 311 and ask for the **Tenant Helpline** or \u201cRight to Counsel\u201d if you\u2019re low income.  \n   - Legal services groups: Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC, Mobilization for Justice, etc.  \n   - Tenant unions or groups (e.g., Met Council on Housing) can also help you read your rent history.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether you know your apartment is (or was) rent-stabilized,\n- Approximately when you moved in,\n- What your current legal rent is,\n- Whether your landlord recently said the unit is \u201cno longer stabilized,\u201d\n\nI can walk you through, step by step, whether your specific unit can lawfully be deregulated based on current NYC law.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: No \u2014 if your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled in New York City, it cannot be deregulated solely because your rent goes above a certain dollar amount or because your household income rises. The 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) ended the old \u201chigh\u2011rent/high\u2011income\u201d (luxury) deregulation rules.\n\nWhat that means in practice\n- If your unit is rent\u2011stabilized: Your apartment stays stabilized regardless of how high the rent becomes or how much your household earns. Landlords can no longer remove units from stabilization on the basis of tenant income or rent level (including on vacancy).\n- If your unit is rent\u2011controlled: Rent control has its own narrow rules, but it is not lost simply because of tenant income or rent level.\n- If your unit was never subject to rent stabilization or rent control (for example, a market\u2011rate unit in a building not covered by stabilization), then landlord charging market rent is lawful \u2014 but that is not \u201cderegulation\u201d of a protected unit.\n\nPossible exceptions and other ways a unit can stop being regulated\n- The apartment might never have been covered (e.g., building has fewer than six units and never registered for stabilization, or it\u2019s a post\u20111974 building not covered by stabilization).\n- Building sale, condo/co\u2011op conversion, demolition, or an owner obtaining a lawful deregulation/removal based on very specific tax or exemption changes might change status \u2014 but these are not simply income/rent triggers.\n- Major Capital Improvement (MCI) rent adjustments or other legal rent increases affect rent level but don\u2019t remove stabilization by themselves.\n\nWhat to do if your landlord claims deregulation because of rent or income\n1. Ask for written proof of the claimed deregulation and the legal basis. Landlords must show a lawful change of status.\n2. Get your rent history and the building\u2019s registration status from New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). HCR can tell you whether the unit is registered as stabilized.\n3. Keep copies of leases, renewal offers, rent receipts and any income certifications you provided.\n4. If you\u2019re being told you lost protections, file a complaint or request review with HCR and consider contacting a tenant attorney or free legal help (Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC, or local tenant organizations). You can also call 311 for referrals to tenant resources.\n\nWhere to get official info or help\n- New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR) website \u2014 look for Rent Stabilization and Rent History information.\n- NYC 311 or local tenant legal services (Legal Aid, Legal Services NYC, Mobilization for Justice, tenant associations).\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- whether you currently have a lease renewal marked \u201crent\u2011stabilized\u201d or similar, or\n- the building size and year built, or\n- whether your landlord is trying to remove stabilization \u2014 and I\u2019ll help you check the likely status and next steps.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) sets rent levels for stabilized apartments. The RGB has the authority to regulate rents based on factors such as operating costs, tenant income, and market conditions.\n\nTo determine if your occupied apartment can be deregulated due to your rent level and income, you'll need to understand how rent stabilization works in NYC. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Rent Stabilization**: The majority of apartments in NYC are subject to rent stabilization laws (RL-9/RL-11). Rent-stabilized apartments have a maximum annual rent increase, which is calculated based on the apartment's operating costs.\n2. **Deregulation**: When an apartment becomes deregulated, its rent is no longer subject to the Rent Guidelines Board's annual rent increases. This usually happens when the apartment's rent exceeds the maximum allowable amount or when a new tenant moves in and pays a higher rent than the previous tenant.\n3. **Rent Level and Income**: To deregulate your occupied apartment, your landlord would need to demonstrate that your rent is significantly above market rate, considering your income level.\n\nTo qualify for deregulation, you'll need to meet certain conditions:\n\n* Your gross household income must be at least 125% of the applicable Area Median Income (AMI) for NYC.\n* Your rent must exceed the maximum allowable amount by a specific percentage (currently 20% in most cases).\n\nHere's an example:\n\nLet's say your current rent is $3,500 per month. If you earn more than $125,000 per year (approximately $10,416 per month), and your landlord can demonstrate that your rent is at least 20% above the maximum allowable amount for a stabilized apartment of similar size and quality in your area, then your apartment could potentially be deregulated.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a complex process, and there are many factors to consider. It's essential to consult with a knowledgeable real estate attorney or housing counselor to determine whether you're eligible for deregulation and what the implications might be.\n\nRemember, even if you're not eligible for deregulation, you may still have protection under NYC rent laws. If you're concerned about your rent level or facing issues related to rent increases, consider consulting with a professional advisor for guidance."

This helps determine if/when and how the apartment was deregulated.\n   - **Compare lease language**:\n     - Does your lease or rider call the apartment \u201crent-stabilized\u201d?\n     - Did you get a rent-stabilization rider with your first lease?\n   - **Talk to a tenant lawyer or tenant organization** if:\n     - Your landlord is claiming deregulation recently.\n     - You suspect the deregulation was improper.\n     - You\u2019re being asked to sign a \u201cmarket\u201d lease but think you should still be stabilized.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The building size,\n- Year built,\n- Whether the building gets/received J\u201151 or 421\u2011a,\n- What your lease/rider says, and\n- Any recent rent jumps,\n\nI can walk through whether your unit likely *can* be deregulated and whether a market-rate offer is lawful in your situation.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Yes \u2014 but only if the apartment is actually no longer subject to rent regulation. If your unit has been properly \u201cderegulated,\u201d the landlord can offer a market\u2011rate lease (or charge market rent after a lawful lease ends). However, deregulation is now much harder to accomplish under current New York law, and landlords frequently make improper or illegal deregulation claims.\n\nKey points you need to know\n- Since the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA), \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d and \u201chigh\u2011rent/high\u2011income\u201d deregulation were eliminated. A landlord can no longer take a rent\u2011stabilized apartment out of stabilization simply because the rent reached a certain level or because a tenant\u2019s income is high.\n- A unit can be out of regulation for other reasons (for example the building was never covered, the building converted or was removed from coverage for lawful reasons, or the landlord obtained a valid deregulation through very specific procedures). If the unit is truly deregulated, the landlord may offer market rent once the current lease ends or if the law allows a new tenancy at market rent.\n- If you have a current lease, the landlord must honor its terms until it expires. If your lease expires and the apartment is still rent\u2011stabilized, the landlord must follow rent\u2011stabilization rules for renewal offers and allowable increases.\n\nWhat to do next (practical steps)\n1. Don\u2019t accept a rent increase or new lease if you\u2019re unsure. Ask the landlord for written proof the apartment is no longer rent\u2011stabilized (DHCR/HUD/HPD documentation or deregulation paperwork).\n2. Get the apartment\u2019s rent history and registration status:\n   - Request a rent history from NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR). Rent histories show whether an apartment has been registered as rent\u2011stabilized and the lawful rents charged.\n   - Check whether the landlord registers the unit annually with HPD/HCR (landlords of stabilized units must register rents).\n3. If the landlord claims deregulation but the unit is still registered as stabilized, refuse the market rent and consider paying the lawful (regulated) rent only. If you believe the landlord is charging illegal rent, do not simply pay the higher amount without consulting counsel \u2014 paying a higher rent can sometimes be used against you later.\n4. If the landlord sues to evict for nonpayment of the offered market rent, you can raise the apartment\u2019s regulated status as a defense and submit the rent history/registration as evidence.\n5. Get help: contact a tenant attorney or free tenant legal services (Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, or your local tenant union/coalition). You can also call 311 for HPD/tenant resources.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Are you currently rent\u2011stabilized or under a lease?\n- Did the landlord give a notice saying the unit is deregulated or offer a new market\u2011rate lease?\nWith that I can tell you the most relevant documents to request and the likely next steps.",
            "llama3": "The joys of deregulation!\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when an apartment is deregulated, the landlord is indeed allowed to charge a higher \"market-rate\" rent. However, there are some nuances to consider.\n\n**What does deregulation mean?**\n\nDeregulation typically occurs when a rent-stabilized or rent-controlled unit becomes available for rent again (e.g., after a tenant moves out). The landlord can then set the rent at market rate, which is usually higher than what would be allowed under rent stabilization or control laws.\n\n**Can the landlord charge any price they want?**\n\nNo. Even though the apartment is deregulated, there are still some protections in place to prevent extreme rent increases. For example:\n\n1. **Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) regulations**: In New York City, for instance, the Rent Guidelines Board sets annual rent increase limits for deregulated apartments.\n2. **Local laws and regulations**: Your city or town may have specific laws governing rent increases, even for deregulated units.\n3. **FDCPA and federal regulations**: Federal laws like the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) still apply to rent collections.\n\n**How high can market-rate rents be?**\n\nMarket-rate rents are typically determined by supply and demand in your area. In a competitive rental market, landlords may offer higher rents to attract tenants willing to pay more. However, they must still comply with local laws and regulations regarding rent increases.\n\n**What are my options if I'm facing a significant rent increase?**\n\nIf you're facing a rent increase that's too high for your budget, consider the following:\n\n1. **Negotiate**: Try to negotiate with your landlord to see if they can offer a lower rent.\n2. **Explore alternatives**: Look into other apartments in your area to see what similar units are renting for.\n3. **Seek assistance**: If you're struggling to pay the increased rent, reach out to local non-profits or government agencies that provide rental assistance programs.\n\nRemember to carefully review any new lease agreement and understand your obligations before signing.\n\nI hope this helps!

The exact rules depend on whether the development is supervised by HPD (city) or HCR (state), but the core requirements are similar.\n\nBelow are the main eligibility requirements that typically apply.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Income Limits\n\n**At initial admission**\n\n- Your household income must fall within the income limits set for that development.\n- Limits vary by:\n  - Supervising agency (HPD vs. HCR)\n  - Development\n  - Apartment size\n  - Whether it\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d or \u201cSection 8\u2013assisted\u201d Mitchell\u2011Lama\n\nIncome is generally calculated using **gross income** for all household members (with some adjustments). Certain income exclusions or allowances can apply (e.g., some student income, certain disability benefits, etc.), depending on the program rules.\n\n**To remain eligible as a tenant**\n\n- Each year, you have to complete an **annual income recertification**.\n- If your income rises above certain thresholds, for rentals you may:\n  - Stay, but pay a **surcharge** (a percentage added on top of the basic rent), or\n  - In more extreme cases (very substantial over\u2011income, depending on the rules and how long it continues), the agency can require you to **vacate**.  \n- For most Mitchell\u2011Lama rentals, there is a **maximum income limit to move in** and a somewhat higher threshold to **remain** (often tied to a \u201csurcharge\u201d schedule).\n\nYou have to:\n- Report all income honestly\n- Provide documentation (tax returns, paystubs, benefit letters, etc.)\n- Report any major change (e.g., new job, loss of job, change in household size) if the development\u2019s rules require interim reporting.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Household Composition / Occupancy Standards\n\nMitchell\u2011Lama apartments are matched to family size. For both admission and continued occupancy:\n\n- The apartment must not be **overcrowded** (too many people for the bedroom count) or **underoccupied** (too few people for the bedroom count) according to the supervising agency\u2019s standards.\n- Typical rules (exact standards vary by project, but commonly):\n  - Studio: 1\u20132 persons\n  - 1 bedroom: 1\u20133 persons\n  - 2 bedroom: 2\u20135 persons\n  - 3 bedroom: 3\u20137 persons\n  - 4 bedroom: 4\u20138 persons\n\nIf your household shrinks (e.g., children move out), you may be required:\n- To **transfer to a smaller apartment** when one is available, or\n- To pay a different rent if you stay in a larger apartment without qualifying for it.\n\nEveryone living in the apartment must be **authorized occupants** and listed on your annual income affidavit, except short\u2011term guests within allowable limits. Unauthorized occupants can be grounds for termination.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Primary Residence Requirement\n\nTo be eligible to **stay** in a Mitchell\u2011Lama rental:\n\n- The apartment must be your **primary residence**, meaning:\n  - You live there on a permanent, ongoing basis.\n  - You do not maintain a primary residence elsewhere.\n- Indicators of primary residence typically include:\n  - NYC address on tax returns\n  - Voter registration\n  - Driver\u2019s license/ID, vehicle registration\n  - Where you actually spend most of your time\n- Long, frequent, or unexplained absences (e.g., most of the year somewhere else) can lead to a claim that you are **not** using the unit as your primary residence.\n\nIf management suspects non\u2011primary residence, they can:\n- Investigate (request documents, conduct interviews)\n- Bring a proceeding to **terminate your tenancy** for non\u2011primary residence.\n\n---\n\n## 4. No Ownership of Other Suitable Housing (often required)\n\nMany Mitchell\u2011Lama programs bar tenants from owning or having a beneficial interest in **suitable residential property**:\n\n- Often you cannot:\n  - Own a home, condo, or co\u2011op (sometimes anywhere, sometimes within a certain radius)\n  - Have a beneficial interest in such property (e.g., through a trust, LLC, etc.)\n- Some developments have stricter or looser versions of this rule, but:\n  - Buying and moving into another residence, or\n  - Owning suitable, available housing you could live in  \n  can jeopardize your eligibility.\n\nYou must report if you acquire an ownership interest in residential real estate, including inheritances.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Legal Status and Age\n\nFor admission (and sometimes for continued occupancy, depending on the specific program):\n\n- The head of household generally must be at least **18 years old**.\n- Household members normally must have a **lawful immigration status** that allows them to reside in the US; program rules can be complex where there are mixed\u2011status families, but misrepresentation about status can be grounds for termination.\n- Certain criminal background issues can be considered at the **screening** stage; they are supposed to be evaluated individually and consistent with NYC Human Rights Law and any agency guidance.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Compliance With Rules and Recertification\n\nStaying eligible also requires **following program and building rules**:\n\n- Complete **annual recertifications**:\n  - On time\n  - With accurate information\n  - With supporting documents\n- Promptly report any changes you are required to report (income, household size, etc.).\n- Follow house rules (no illegal sublets, no unauthorized roommates beyond allowed limits, no Airbnb, no illegal use, no nuisance behavior).\n\n**Failure to recertify**, or knowingly giving false information, can lead to surcharges, retroactive charges, or termination of tenancy.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Succession / Remaining Family Member\n\nIf a tenant dies or permanently leaves:\n\n- Certain **family members or long\u2011term occupants** may have the right to **succeed to the tenancy**.\n- To be eligible, they usually must:\n  - Have been in **legal occupancy** with management\u2019s consent\n  - Have lived in the apartment as their **primary residence** for a specified period (commonly at least 2 years immediately before the tenant\u2019s permanent departure, or 1 year for seniors or disabled occupants; check the specific Mitchell\u2011Lama rules and recent guidance)\n  - Meet all the other eligibility requirements (income limits, occupancy standards, etc.)\n\nIf you\u2019re a current tenant, your own continued eligibility isn\u2019t affected by someone else\u2019s succession rights, but if you\u2019re the person seeking succession, you must independently satisfy the same kinds of eligibility requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Differences Between HPD and HCR Supervision\n\nBecause you said you live in a Mitchell\u2011Lama development, the precise requirements depend on who supervises it:\n\n- **HPD (NYC Department of Housing Preservation & Development)** \u2013 city\u2011supervised Mitchell\u2011Lama\n- **HCR (NYS Homes and Community Renewal)** \u2013 state\u2011supervised Mitchell\u2011Lama\n\nThey have slightly different:\n- Income limit tables\n- Surcharge rules\n- Transfer/over\u2011/under\u2011occupancy procedures\n- Succession standards\n\nYour development\u2019s managing agent and offering plan, and the **Mitchell\u2011Lama rules of the supervising agency**, control.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The name of your development, and  \n- Whether your building is HPD\u2011supervised or HCR\u2011supervised (or I can help you figure that out),\n\nI can walk through the *exact* income and occupancy rules that apply to your building and your household size right now.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Mitchell\u2011Lama developments set eligibility by each building\u2019s regulatory agreement and admissions plan, so there is no single uniform rule for all Mitchell\u2011Lama buildings. However, most applicants must meet requirements in these general categories:\n\nWhat eligibility usually covers\n- Income limits: Households must fall within minimum and maximum income limits for the unit being offered. The exact limits vary by development, unit size and whether the building was financed under a low\u2011 or middle\u2011income set\u2011aside. Limits are based on Area Median Income (AMI) and are set for each building.\n- Household size/occupancy: Your household must be an appropriate size for the apartment (a minimum and maximum number of people per bedroom).\n- Legal status: Applicants must be U.S. citizens or otherwise have eligible immigration status (proper documentation will be required).\n- Credit, rental history and criminal background: Landlords typically check income verification, rental history and may screen for certain criminal records or prior evictions.\n- Asset rules: Some developments count liquid assets and impute income from assets; there may be asset limits or reporting requirements.\n- Preferences: Many developments give priority to local residents, municipal employees, veterans, seniors, people moving from substandard housing, or members of a sponsor\u2019s preference list. Preferences and their order are set in the building\u2019s admissions policy.\n- Special unit rules: Senior developments require age eligibility (e.g., 62+). Cooperative (Mitchell\u2011Lama co\u2011op) resale rules add purchase qualifications (down payment, financing, board approval, resale restrictions).\n\nWhat to do for your specific building\n1. Ask management for the building\u2019s current admissions policy (sometimes called the occupancy plan), income limit table, and the regulatory agreement. Those documents list exact income bands, household\u2011size rules and preferences.\n2. If you\u2019re applying, prepare documentation: photo ID, Social Security numbers, pay stubs, W\u20112s/tax returns, bank statements, proof of assets, birth certificates or immigration documents, and rental history/references.\n3. If you\u2019re a current tenant wondering about continued eligibility: existing tenants generally remain covered under the terms you moved in under; income recertification rules depend on whether you occupy an income\u2011targeted unit\u2014ask management.\n4. If you have questions or a dispute, contact:\n   - NYS Homes & Community Renewal (HCR) \u2014 Mitchell\u2011Lama unit (oversees state Mitchell\u2011Lama) or\n   - NYC Department of Housing Preservation & Development (HPD) if the development has city involvement.\n   You can also get free legal help from Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, or a tenant advocacy group.\n\nIf you want, tell me the name/address of your Mitchell\u2011Lama development and whether it\u2019s rental or co\u2011op, and I can try to find the building\u2019s admissions policy or the agency that regulates it.",
            "llama3": "Mitchell-Lama developments are a type of affordable housing program in New York City, and as a tenant, you must meet certain eligibility requirements to qualify for residency. Here are the basic criteria:\n\n1. **Income limits**: Your household income must be below a certain threshold, which varies depending on the development's location, size, and affordability level. Typically, this is around 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). For example, if the AMI is $100,000, your household income would need to be less than $60,000 ($100,000 x 0.6) to qualify.\n2. **Rent-to-income ratio**: Your rent payment must not exceed a certain percentage of your monthly gross income. This ensures that you can afford the rent and still have enough money for other expenses. The maximum allowed ratio is usually around 30%.\n3. **Family size and composition**: The number of people in your household, including children, must be within the development's family-size limits.\n4. **Citizenship or immigration status**: You must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident (green card holder), or meet specific immigration requirements to qualify for Mitchell-Lama residency.\n\nTo become eligible for a Mitchell-Lama apartment, you'll typically need to provide documentation that proves your income, employment, and family composition. This may include:\n\n1. Pay stubs or W-2 forms\n2. Tax returns (if self-employed)\n3. Proof of employment or unemployment benefits\n4. Birth certificates or identification documents for all household members\n5. Proof of immigration status (for non-U.S. citizens)\n\nKeep in mind that eligibility requirements might vary depending on the specific Mitchell-Lama development and its governing body. If you're unsure about your eligibility or have questions, it's best to contact the management office or a housing counselor for guidance.\n\nI hope this helps!"

In NYC public housing (NYCHA), you\u2019re generally entitled to an internal \u201cgrievance\u201d process before eviction, but there are some important exceptions.\n\n### 1. General rule: you get a grievance first\nNYCHA must normally:\n1. Give you written notice of the proposed termination of tenancy (charges/grounds).\n2. Give you an opportunity for an *informal* conference.\n3. If not resolved, give you a *formal* grievance hearing before an impartial hearing officer.\n4. Only after a final decision against you can NYCHA start a holdover case (eviction) in Housing Court.\n\nThis is based on HUD rules (24 C.F.R. Part 966) and NYCHA\u2019s own procedures.\n\n### 2. Key exceptions (when they can skip the grievance)\nNYCHA can go straight to Housing Court without offering you a grievance **if** the case falls into specific categories that HUD says are \u201cnot subject to grievance procedures,\u201d for example:\n\n- **Criminal activity that threatens the health/safety** of other residents, NYCHA staff, or persons off the property.\n- **Violent or drug\u2011related criminal activity** on or near the premises.\n- **Certain serious lease violations** where HUD and NYCHA have designated them as \u201cnon\u2011grievable\u201d and NYCHA gives you written notice that:\n  - The case is being treated as not covered by the grievance process, and  \n  - You still have the right to raise defenses and arguments in Housing Court.\n\nIf NYCHA is claiming your case is \u201cnon\u2011grievable,\u201d the notice should explicitly say so and cite that you can only contest it in court.\n\n### 3. Due process in Housing Court\nEven if NYCHA skips the internal grievance:\n- They **must** still bring a court case (they cannot just lock you out).\n- You have the right to:\n  - Get notice of the court case (a petition).\n  - Appear in Housing Court, answer the petition, and present defenses.\n  - Have a trial if it\u2019s not settled.\n  - Be represented by a lawyer; in NYC, many public housing tenants qualify for free counsel under the Right to Counsel law.\n\n### 4. What you should do now\n- **Check your papers:** Look at any termination notice or letter.  \n  - Does it offer a grievance/hearing?  \n  - Or does it say your case is \u201cnot subject to NYCHA\u2019s grievance procedure\u201d?\n- **Don\u2019t ignore deadlines:** Grievances and court answers have strict time limits.\n- **Get legal help quickly:**\n  - Legal Aid Society\n  - Legal Services NYC\n  - Neighborhood Defender Service\n  - Bronx/Queens/Brooklyn/Manhattan Legal Services\n  - If you\u2019re already in Housing Court, ask the clerk for the \u201cRight to Counsel\u201d or \u201cUniversal Access\u201d office for a free lawyer.\n\nIf you tell me what kind of notice you received (and roughly what it says about the reason for termination), I can tell you more precisely whether NYCHA should have given you a grievance first and what to argue.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: In most cases, no \u2014 the housing authority must give you an opportunity to use its grievance/hearing process before it terminates your tenancy and evicts you. But there are important exceptions (mainly for certain criminal or emergency situations) and the housing authority still must get a court judgment to physically remove you.\n\nWhat generally applies\n- Public housing authorities (including NYCHA) are governed by HUD\u2019s public-housing regulations and by the terms of your public-housing lease. Those rules require the authority to offer an administrative grievance or hearing to residents before terminating the tenancy or evicting for most reasons.  \n- That administrative process is separate from a court eviction proceeding. Even if the authority moves to evict in housing court, you may have the right to an internal hearing and you can raise defenses in court as well.  \n- The housing authority may not lawfully change locks, cut off utilities, or physically remove you without a court order (no self-help evictions).\n\nImportant exceptions\n- The housing authority may bypass the grievance/hearing procedure in certain limited circumstances, most commonly where there is criminal activity that threatens the health or safety of other residents (including certain drug- and violent-crime situations) or other imminent threats. HUD regulations allow public housing authorities to exclude routine grievance procedures in those narrow emergency/criminal circumstances.  \n- Even when an internal hearing is excused, the authority generally still needs to use the courts to obtain possession or rely on criminal enforcement (e.g., arrest/ trespass), depending on the situation.\n\nWhat you should do now\n1. Read any notices carefully \u2014 they will explain the reason for termination and any deadlines to request a hearing. Request the hearing in writing immediately and keep copies.  \n2. If you receive court papers, appear on the scheduled date and raise any defenses. Missing court can result in a default eviction judgment.  \n3. Don\u2019t self-help (don\u2019t leave belongings behind thinking you\u2019ll \u201cget them later\u201d); illegal lockouts are a violation of law.  \n4. Get legal help right away \u2014 Legal Aid Society, NYC Housing Court Help Centers, NYLAG, or a tenant attorney can help with deadlines and defenses. You can also contact NYCHA\u2019s tenant resources (or call 311 for NYC services).\n\nIf you want, tell me what your notice says or the reason NYCHA gave for eviction and I can explain whether you likely have a right to a grievance/hearing and suggest next steps.",
            "llama3": "In general, yes, a public housing authority (PHA) can evict you from your apartment without giving you a prior opportunity to appeal or grieve the eviction decision. Here's why:\n\n1. **No right to a hearing**: Unlike private landlords, PHAs are not required by law to provide a pre-eviction hearing to tenants in public housing.\n2. **Eviction procedures outlined in regulations**: The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has established specific guidelines for evictions from public housing properties, which vary by state or local jurisdiction. These procedures typically outline the steps that must be followed before an eviction can take place.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions and considerations:\n\n1. **Due process rights**: While you may not have a right to a pre-eviction hearing, you still have constitutional due process rights. This means that if your PHA is planning to evict you without just cause, you may be able to challenge the eviction in court.\n2. **Grievance procedures**: Many PHAs have their own internal grievance processes for handling issues related to tenant disputes, including evictions. If your PHA has such a process in place, you may be able to appeal the eviction decision through this channel before an actual eviction occurs.\n\nTo protect yourself and ensure that your rights are respected:\n\n1. **Familiarize yourself with your PHA's policies**: Review your lease agreement or other relevant documents to understand the specific procedures and grounds for eviction.\n2. **Keep records of any issues**: Document any concerns, disputes, or incidents that may lead to an eviction attempt. This can help you establish a paper trail and support your case if necessary.\n3. **Seek legal advice**: If you're facing eviction, consider consulting with an attorney who is experienced in public housing law. They can help you understand your rights and options.\n\nRemember, it's essential to stay informed about the specific laws and regulations governing public housing in your area, as well as any internal procedures that may apply."

            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer \u2014 HUD rules (which NYC\u2019s voucher programs follow) determine two numbers and the subsidy is the difference between them:\n\n1) Your \u201cfamily share\u201d (Total Tenant Payment, or TTP) \u2014 what you must contribute toward housing based on your income; and\n2) The PHA\u2019s payment standard for the voucher/unit size \u2014 the maximum subsidy the agency will pay for that size apartment.\n\nHow the math works (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n- The PHA calculates your adjusted monthly income (gross income minus HUD deductions such as dependents, childcare, elderly/disabled medical expenses, etc.).\n- The TTP is the greatest of:\n  - 30% of your adjusted monthly income,\n  - 10% of your gross monthly income,\n  - any welfare rent contribution required by your public assistance agency,\n  - (and any PHA minimum rent, if applicable).\n- If you pay utilities, the PHA subtracts a utility allowance from the TTP to determine how much of the rent you pay to the landlord (tenant rent = TTP \u2212 utility allowance; minimum 0).\n- The PHA has a payment standard for your voucher size (based on local market rents / HUD FMRs). The subsidy the PHA will pay (the Housing Assistance Payment, HAP) equals the lesser of:\n  - the contract rent for the unit, or\n  - the payment standard,\n  minus the tenant rent (the family share after utility allowance).\n  In other words: HAP = min(payment standard, contract rent) \u2212 tenant rent.\n- If the landlord\u2019s rent is higher than the payment standard, you must pay the difference in addition to your tenant rent share (so you can be required to pay more than the TTP).\n\nExample\n- Adjusted monthly income $2,000 \u2192 TTP = 30% = $600.\n- Utility allowance $100 (you pay utilities) \u2192 tenant rent = $600 \u2212 $100 = $500.\n- Payment standard for your unit size = $1,200.\n- If landlord\u2019s rent (contract rent) = $1,100: subsidy = 1,100 \u2212 500 = $600; you pay $500.\n- If contract rent = $1,400: subsidy = 1,200 \u2212 500 = $700; you pay $1,400 \u2212 700 = $700 (which is $200 more than the $500 tenant rent because the rent exceeds the payment standard).\n\nOther points to know\n- PHAs recertify income (usually annually) and require you to report some interim changes; your subsidy changes with your income and household composition.\n- Utility allowances matter \u2014 if the landlord pays utilities, you don\u2019t get a utility allowance and your tenant share will be larger.\n- Some vouchers (project\u2011based, special programs) have program\u2011specific rules, but the basic income/payment\u2011standard math is the same.\n- NYC\u2019s PHAs (NYCHA, HPD vouchers administered by HRA or other PHAs) follow HUD rules when computing TTP and set payment standards based on local rent data.\n\nIf you want, tell me your adjusted monthly income, who lives with you (dependents/elderly/disabled), the unit size, the contract rent and whether you pay utilities \u2014 I can run the numbers for you.",
            "llama3": "Section 8, also known as the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, is a federal housing assistance program that helps low-income families rent homes in the private market. The amount of rent subsidy you receive depends on several factors. Here's how Section 8 decides:\n\n1. **Income**: Your monthly income is used to determine your eligibility for the program and the amount of subsidy you'll receive. The income limit varies by area, but generally, it's 50% of the area median gross income (AMGI).\n2. **Rent**: The rent charged by your landlord is the basis for calculating your subsidy. Section 8 will pay a portion of this rent to help you cover your housing costs.\n3. **Subsidy calculation**: The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides a formula to calculate the maximum monthly subsidy (MMS). This amount is based on:\n\t* Your income\n\t* The number of people in your household\n\t* The rent charged by your landlord\n\t* The payment standard (PS) for your area, which reflects the average cost of housing\n\nThe MMS is calculated as follows:\n\nMMS = (Family Income x 0.30) + (Number of People x $12.50)\n\nExample: If you have a household income of $2,500 per month and three people in your household, your MMS would be:\n\nMMS = ($2,500 x 0.30) + (3 x $12.50) = $750 + $37.50 = $787.50\n\n4. **Payment standard**: The payment standard is the maximum amount that Section 8 will pay for a specific unit in your area. This standard is set by HUD and varies depending on the location.\n5. **Rent reasonableness**: To ensure that the rent you're paying is reasonable, Section 8 will compare your rent to the payment standard. If your rent is higher than the payment standard, they may adjust your subsidy accordingly.\n\nIn summary, Section 8 calculates your subsidy by considering your income, the number of people in your household, the rent charged by your landlord, and the payment standard for your area. The goal is to help you afford housing that's reasonable and safe."

            "gpt-5.1": "No. In New York City, a landlord generally cannot change the terms of a signed lease in the middle of the lease term unless:\n\n1. **The lease itself allows that specific change** *and*  \n2. The change is lawful under NYC and NY State law, and  \n3. You agree where your agreement is legally required.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works in practice:\n\n### 1. Fixed\u2011term leases (most apartments)\nIf you have a fixed\u2011term lease (e.g., 1 year, 2 years):\n\n- The landlord **cannot unilaterally change**:\n  - The rent amount\n  - Who pays which utilities\n  - Access rules (e.g., guest policy) in a way that materially changes your rights\n  - Other core terms (like use of space, services promised, etc.)\n- Those terms are **locked in until the lease expires**, except:\n  - If the lease has a **clear, specific clause** allowing a certain change (for example, a legally required building-wide fuel surcharge, or a change required by law), and  \n  - That clause is **not prohibited by rent\u2011regulation rules or general contract law**.\n\nYour landlord saying \u201cwe can change the lease whenever we want\u201d is **not** enough. They need a specific, valid clause in the lease or a legal basis.\n\n### 2. Rent\u2011stabilized apartments\nIf your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized (very common in NYC):\n\n- The landlord **cannot** change terms mid\u2011lease to your detriment except where specifically allowed by rent stabilization rules (e.g., lawful Major Capital Improvement or Individual Apartment Improvement surcharges, and even those are regulated and notice is required).\n- Rent increases are **only** allowed on renewal under the Rent Guidelines Board rules or as specifically allowed by regulation.\n- They cannot just rewrite rules or fees in the middle of the term and force you to accept them.\n\n### 3. \u201cHouse rules\u201d vs. lease terms\nLandlords sometimes have \u201chouse rules\u201d:\n\n- They can adopt **reasonable house rules** related to safety, building operations, or quiet enjoyment.  \n- But they **cannot use house rules to override the lease** or impose substantial new burdens that effectively change the lease (e.g., suddenly banning all guests, charging new mandatory fees not mentioned anywhere in the lease, etc.).\n- For rent\u2011stabilized tenants, house rules must be **reasonable, applied uniformly, and not inconsistent** with rent stabilization.\n\n### 4. Changes required by law\nIf a **law or government order** requires a change (for example, a new local law about safety, access, or building systems):\n\n- The landlord **must comply**, and you generally must comply too.\n- That\u2019s not the same as the landlord having free discretion to change economic or occupancy terms whenever they want.\n\n### 5. If they present a \u201clease addendum\u201d mid\u2011term\nIf your landlord hands you a new form or addendum during the lease:\n\n- You do **not** have to sign it unless:\n  - You genuinely agree, and  \n  - There is no legal requirement that would make refusal a problem (rare).\n- They cannot legally evict you just because you refuse to sign a mid\u2011term change to a fixed\u2011term lease.\n\n### 6. What you can do now\n- **Read your lease**: Look for:\n  - Any clause about \u201cLandlord\u2019s right to adopt rules\u201d  \n  - Any clause about changing services, charges, or access\n- **Ask for specifics in writing**:  \n  \u201cPlease specify exactly what lease terms you are seeking to change and the legal basis for changing them before the lease ends.\u201d\n- **Document everything**: Keep communications in writing (email/text) if possible.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether your unit is rent\u2011stabilized, market\u2011rate, or something else  \n- What exact change the landlord is claiming they can make  \n\nI can give more precise guidance and suggest how to phrase a response.\n\nFor formal legal advice or if they start threatening non\u2011renewal or eviction, you should contact:\n- Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, or  \n- 311 \u2192 ask for the Tenant Helpline / tenant legal services.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: No \u2014 not usually. A lease is a binding contract. During a fixed-term lease (for example, a 6\u2011 or 12\u2011month lease) the landlord generally cannot change its material terms (rent, length, who lives there, services provided, etc.) without your agreement. Any change should be made by a written, signed amendment to the lease.\n\nKey points and exceptions\n\n- Fixed-term leases: The landlord may not unilaterally change terms during the lease term. If they try, you can insist on the original terms and treat an improper demand as a breach of the lease (or as harassment if they use illegal pressure).\n- Month-to-month/periodic tenancies: The landlord can change some terms going forward by giving proper advance notice. In practice, that means they must notify you in writing and give the required notice period before the change takes effect \u2014 you are not required to accept a retroactive change. (If you don\u2019t agree to the change you can move or negotiate; failure to accept certain changes may be treated as termination of a periodic tenancy.)\n- Lease clauses that claim unilateral changes: Some leases include language giving the landlord the right to change \u201crules\u201d or other terms. Courts may enforce reasonable building rules, but provisions that give the landlord unlimited, unilateral power to change essential lease terms are often unenforceable, especially if they try to waive statutory tenant protections.\n- Rent-regulated apartments: If you live in a rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled unit, there are additional protections. Rent-stabilized tenants cannot have rent or core lease terms changed except in very limited, regulated ways \u2014 contact DHCR or a lawyer before agreeing to any change.\n- Illegal landlord actions: A landlord cannot lawfully change locks, shut off utilities, remove your belongings, or otherwise use \u201cself-help\u201d to force compliance. Those actions are illegal and can be challenged immediately.\n\nWhat you should do now\n\n1. Read your lease to see whether it\u2019s a fixed-term or month-to-month tenancy and whether it contains any amendment clauses.  \n2. Don\u2019t sign or agree verbally to changes you don\u2019t want. Get any agreed change in writing and signed by both parties.  \n3. Keep records of communications (texts, emails, letters).  \n4. If the landlord threatens illegal measures (lockout, utility shutoff) or is trying to impose rent or other material changes mid\u2011lease, contact NYC 311 for tenant resources, NYC Housing Preservation & Development (HPD), or a tenant attorney/Legal Aid. If your apartment is rent\u2011regulated, contact NYS DHCR first.  \n5. If you want, I can help you review the lease language or draft a short response to the landlord.\n\nIf you tell me whether your lease is fixed-term or month-to-month and whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized, I can give more specific guidance.",
            "llama3": "The joys of rental agreements! In most jurisdictions, a lease is a binding contract between you and your landlord. While your landlord may have some flexibility to make changes, they generally cannot unilaterally modify the lease terms without your consent.\n\nHere's what you should know:\n\n1. **Initial lease term**: When you signed the lease, you agreed to the terms for a specific period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year). This initial term is usually set forth in the lease agreement.\n2. **Renewal or modification**: If your landlord wants to make changes to the lease during the initial term, they typically need to provide written notice to you, as per the terms of the original lease. The notice period may vary depending on your jurisdiction and the type of rental property.\n3. **Notice requirements**: In most states, landlords are required to provide a certain amount of notice (e.g., 30 days) before making changes to the lease or terminating it. This ensures you have sufficient time to respond or find alternative accommodations.\n\nTo determine what's allowed in your situation, review your lease agreement and check local laws regarding rental agreements. If you're unsure about any specific terms or requirements, consider consulting with a lawyer or a tenant advocacy organization for guidance.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n1. **Review the lease**: Carefully read through your lease agreement to understand the original terms and any clauses related to changes or modifications.\n2. **Communicate with your landlord**: If your landlord proposes changes, ask them to provide written notice and specify what those changes are. This will help clarify their intentions and give you time to consider your options.\n3. **Seek legal guidance**: If you're unsure about the validity of any proposed changes or have concerns about your lease terms, consult with a lawyer or a tenant advocacy organization.\n\nRemember, as a tenant, you have certain rights under the law. Be prepared to assert those rights if necessary, and don't hesitate to seek professional advice if you need help navigating the process."

            "gpt-5.1": "Yes, an oral lease is allowed in NYC for a non\u2013rent-stabilized apartment, but with some important limits:\n\n1. **Term length limit (Statute of Frauds)**  \n   - In New York, any lease for **more than one year** must be **in writing** to be enforceable (General Obligations Law \u00a7 5\u2011703).  \n   - An **oral agreement is legally valid** only if:\n     - It\u2019s **month-to-month**, or  \n     - It\u2019s for a **fixed term of one year or less**.\n\n2. **Month-to-month tenancies**  \n   - If you\u2019re just paying rent and living there without a written lease, the law usually treats this as a **month-to-month tenancy** (assuming the landlord accepts rent regularly).\n   - Either party can terminate a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy with proper written notice under the **new \u201cgood cause\u201d / notice rules (Friedman v. New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development & RPAPL changes)**, but generally:\n     - Landlord must give **written notice** before seeking to end the tenancy or raise rent significantly, with timing depending on how long you\u2019ve been there (30/60/90 days).\n   - In NYC, a landlord must follow the **Rent Demand** and **Holdover** court procedures; they cannot just lock you out.\n\n3. **Non\u2013rent-stabilized vs. rent-stabilized**  \n   - Rent\u2011stabilized tenants must be offered **renewal leases in writing** on DHCR forms and are subject to specific rent rules.  \n   - For **unregulated/non\u2011stabilized** apartments, there is **no requirement** that the agreement be written if it\u2019s for one year or less or month\u2011to\u2011month; written leases are just strongly recommended for clarity.\n\n4. **Required documents even with oral lease**  \n   Even if the lease itself is oral, NYC landlords still have to comply with certain written disclosure rules, such as:\n   - **Lead paint disclosure** (if building built before 1978 and a child under 6 may reside there).\n   - **Window guard notices**.\n   - **Bedbug history disclosure** (Form HPD has a standard form).  \n   These requirements don\u2019t disappear because the lease is oral.\n\n5. **Practical issues**  \n   - Enforcing specific terms (like who pays utilities, renewal promises, or use of security deposit) can be harder with no written lease.\n   - Your proof of tenancy is typically rent receipts, bank records (Zelle/Venmo/checks), texts/emails with landlord, etc.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- How long you\u2019ve been there,\n- Whether you were promised a particular fixed term (e.g., \u201cI can stay for two years\u201d),\nI can say more precisely whether your current arrangement is likely a valid oral lease for a fixed term or just a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy under NYC law.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Yes \u2014 but with limits.\n\nDetails:\n- New York\u2019s Statute of Frauds (General Obligations Law \u00a75\u2011701) requires that leases longer than one year be in writing. That means oral leases for terms of one year or less (including the common month\u2011to\u2011month oral tenancy) are legally recognized.\n- If you pay rent monthly and there is no written fixed term, the law treats you as a periodic (usually month\u2011to\u2011month) tenant. That tenancy is legal, but it\u2019s harder to prove specific terms (rent amount, who pays utilities, length of notice to quit, etc.) without written documentation.\n- If the apartment actually is rent\u2011stabilized, different rules apply (regulated rent, renewal lease forms, required written lease/renewal notices, DHCR registration). If you\u2019re told the unit is not stabilized but you suspect it might be, you should check the DHCR rent history/lookup or get advice \u2014 tenants in stabilized apartments have important statutory protections that cannot be waived by an oral agreement.\n- Regardless of whether the lease is oral, landlords must follow eviction procedures, maintain the premises, and comply with security\u2011deposit and receipt rules. An oral agreement does not allow illegal lockouts or to avoid statutory landlord obligations.\n\nPractical advice:\n- Get the agreement in writing if possible. Keep rent receipts, bank records, emails/texts about terms or repairs, and any written communication \u2014 these are important evidence if a dispute arises.\n- If you want help confirming whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized or understanding your notice and eviction protections, consider contacting NYC 311 for housing info or a tenant legal services group (Legal Aid, the Legal Assistance hotline, or a tenant advocacy organization).\n\nIf you want, tell me: rent amount, how long you\u2019ve lived there, and whether the landlord gave a written statement or any rent\u2011stabilization paperwork \u2014 I can give more specific guidance.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, it's possible to have an oral lease (also known as a verbal lease) for a non-rent-stabilized apartment. However, there are some important considerations and limitations you should be aware of.\n\nAn oral lease can be legal if all parties agree to the terms and conditions, but it may not provide the same level of protection as a written lease. Here's why:\n\n1. **Oral leases are generally allowed**: In New York City, an oral lease is considered a valid agreement between landlord and tenant, as long as the terms are clear and mutually understood.\n2. **No specific written form required**: Unlike rent-stabilized leases, which require a specific written form (RT-7), there's no standard written format for non-rent-stabilized leases. As long as the parties agree on the essential terms, an oral lease can be enforceable.\n3. **More flexibility**: Oral leases often involve more negotiations and discussions between landlord and tenant, which can lead to a more flexible agreement.\n4. **Less protection**: However, since there's no written record, oral leases may not provide the same level of protection as a written lease. If issues arise during the tenancy, there may be less evidence to rely on.\n\nTo ensure a smooth and successful tenancy, consider the following best practices:\n\n1. **Put essential terms in writing**: Even if you have an oral lease, it's still a good idea to document key terms, such as rent amount, payment frequency, lease duration, and any additional responsibilities.\n2. **Verify lease expiration**: Make sure you understand when the lease expires and what the renewal or termination procedures are.\n3. **Keep records**: Keep track of payments, repairs, and communications with your landlord.\n\nBefore entering into an oral lease, it's essential to have open and clear communication with your landlord. Ensure that both parties agree on the terms and conditions, and be prepared to negotiate any disputes that may arise during the tenancy.\n\nDo you have any specific concerns or questions about your oral lease?

Longer occupancy can require 60 or 90 days\u2019 notice.\n\n4. **Exceptions / wrinkles**  \n   - If there is **any written evidence** of the agreement (email, text, letter, lease draft signed by one party) the analysis could change.  \n   - If the apartment is **rent\u2011stabilized**, other rules may apply to lease renewals and terms, but the Statute of Frauds issue (need for writing beyond 1 year) still matters.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether you actually moved in and started paying rent, and  \n- Whether there is any written communication about the \u201c2\u2011year\u201d term,\n\nI can give more precise guidance on what each side could realistically do in court.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Generally no \u2014 a verbal agreement for a lease longer than one year is not enforceable in New York, so a two\u2011year oral lease cannot ordinarily be enforced in court. But there are important exceptions (equitable doctrines) that can sometimes let a party enforce an oral long lease.\n\nWhy: New York\u2019s Statute of Frauds requires contracts conveying or leasing real property for a term longer than one year to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. An oral 2\u2011year lease therefore usually fails that requirement.\n\nCommon exceptions that can save an oral lease\n- Part performance: If the tenant moved in, took possession, paid rent, and made substantial improvements or otherwise acted in reliance on the agreement, a court may treat the transaction as an equitable (enforceable) lease despite the lack of a written lease. The typical proof is possession + payment of rent (and sometimes improvements).\n- Equitable estoppel: If one party reasonably relied on the oral promise to their detriment (for example, gave up another apartment, made costly repairs), a court may refuse to let the other party invoke the Statute of Frauds.\n- Written memorandum: Any signed writing that evidences the agreement and contains essential terms can satisfy the requirement.\n\nPractical effect\n- If you are the tenant and rely on the 2\u2011year term, keep evidence: rent receipts or bank transfers, emails/texts about the term, witnesses, records of repairs/improvements. That evidence is what a court would use to find part performance or estoppel.\n- If you are the landlord and want to enforce a 2\u2011year term against a tenant, without a signed writing you will have a hard time proving the lease; but you may still be able to establish a shorter tenancy (month\u2011to\u2011month) by the parties\u2019 conduct or rely on any written memorandum.\n- If there\u2019s an eviction or rent dispute, these issues come up in Housing Court; the tenant can assert part\u2011performance/estoppel as a defense.\n\nWhat you should do now\n- Get the agreement in writing and signed by both parties as soon as possible.\n- Preserve all evidence of the oral agreement and performance (payments, texts/emails, witnesses, photos of improvements).\n- If there\u2019s a dispute or an imminent eviction, consult a housing attorney or tenant counsel. In NYC you can contact Legal Aid, NYC Housing Court Answers, or a local tenant organization for help.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether you\u2019re the tenant or landlord and what has already happened (moved in, paid rent, communications), and I can give more specific next steps.",
            "llama3": "In the United States, verbal agreements are generally considered unenforceable in court. This is because written contracts are more difficult to contest or dispute, and provide greater clarity and specificity.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions where a verbal agreement might be enforceable:\n\n1. **Statute of Frauds**: In most states, oral contracts can be enforced if they meet the Statute of Frauds requirements, which typically include:\n\t* The contract is for a significant amount (e.g., $500 or more).\n\t* It's for a specific period longer than one year.\n\t* It involves the transfer of land, goods, or services.\n\nIf your 2-year lease meets these criteria, you may be able to enforce it in court.\n\n2. **Equitable Estoppel**: Even if the agreement doesn't meet the Statute of Frauds requirements, a party might still be able to rely on equitable estoppel. This doctrine allows a party to enforce an oral contract when:\n\t* They reasonably relied on the other party's promises or representations.\n\t* The other party benefited from their reliance.\n\nTo increase the chances of enforcing your verbal lease agreement in court:\n\n1. **Document everything**: Keep detailed records of all interactions, emails, and phone calls related to the lease. This will help establish a paper trail that can support your claims.\n2. **Get a written confirmation**: If possible, ask the other party to confirm the agreement in writing, either via email or a signed document. This could provide additional evidence to support your case.\n3. **Consult with an attorney**: A lawyer familiar with local laws and real estate matters can help you navigate the process and determine the best course of action.\n\nRemember that verbal agreements are generally considered less reliable than written contracts. If you're concerned about the enforceability of your lease, it's always a good idea to consult with an attorney or consider drafting a written agreement."

A clause that tries to excuse a landlord from liability for injuries caused by the landlord\u2019s negligence is often unenforceable as against public policy and because landlords have non\u2011waivable duties to provide safe, habitable premises.\n\nWhat that means in practice\n- Implied warranty of habitability and housing laws: New York (and NYC building and housing codes) impose duties on landlords to keep residential premises safe and livable. Tenants generally cannot contract away those protections.  \n- Public\u2011policy limits: Courts are reluctant to enforce exculpatory clauses in standard residential leases that would free a landlord from ordinary negligence resulting in tenant injury.  \n- Scope and parties matter: Exculpatory clauses are more likely to be enforced in commercial leases between sophisticated parties, or where the tenant clearly and knowingly waives claims. Even then, many courts will not allow a lease to cover gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing.  \n- Conspicuousness and wording: Ambiguous or buried waivers are less likely to be enforced even in closer cases.\n\nWhat you should do now (if you were injured)\n1. Get medical care and preserve medical records.  \n2. Document the hazard and injury: photos, videos, date/time, witness names.  \n3. Notify the landlord in writing about the condition and injury (keep proof of delivery).  \n4. Report dangerous conditions to NYC 311/Housing Preservation & Development or DOB if appropriate so there is an official complaint/record.  \n5. Preserve your lease and the exact wording of the clause.  \n6. Talk to a personal-injury or tenants\u2019 rights lawyer soon \u2014 statutes of limitation apply (personal injury claims in NY are typically governed by a 3\u2011year limitations period).  \n\nIf you want, paste the lease clause here (or upload the exact text) and I can give a more specific read on whether it\u2019s likely enforceable and what steps to take next.",
            "llama3": "Lease clauses attempting to limit or eliminate liability for injuries caused by the landlord's negligence are often challenged in court. While it's possible to include such a clause in a lease, its validity depends on various factors and laws. Here's what you should know:\n\n1. **State-specific laws:** Laws regarding liability waivers vary by state. Some states may not enforce clauses that attempt to limit or eliminate liability for injuries caused by negligence, while others might allow them.\n2. **Public policy considerations:** Courts are hesitant to enforce lease clauses that violate public policy or common law principles. For example, if the landlord's negligence causes an injury, it's generally considered unfair and against public policy to shift the responsibility to the tenant.\n3. **Reasonable foreseeability:** If the landlord knew or should have known about a hazardous condition on their property, they may be held liable even with a lease clause attempting to limit liability. Courts will consider whether the harm was reasonably foreseeable based on the circumstances.\n4. **Federal laws and regulations:** Certain federal laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Fair Housing Act, may preempt state-specific laws and impose liability on landlords for injuries caused by negligence.\n\nIn general, a lease clause attempting to limit or eliminate liability for injuries caused by negligence might be challenged in court if:\n\n* The landlord had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition.\n* A reasonable person would have anticipated the harm.\n* The injury was caused by the landlord's gross negligence or reckless behavior.\n\nTo protect yourself, it's essential to understand your state's laws and any relevant federal regulations. If you're injured while renting a property with such a clause, consult with an attorney experienced in personal injury law to discuss your options and determine the best course of action.\n\nRemember that lease clauses can be negotiated or modified before signing. If you have concerns about liability, it's crucial to address these issues with the landlord before entering into the agreement."

New York courts treat a waiver of the right to a jury trial in a residential lease\u2014especially where it relates to personal injury or property damage claims arising from the landlord\u2019s negligence\u2014as part of an improper attempt to tilt the playing field against tenants.\n\nIn NYC, residential tenants are generally allowed to sue in court and request a jury for negligence-based personal injury or property damage claims. A pre-printed lease clause that says you waive your right to a jury trial in such cases will typically not be enforced against you.\n\nThe landlord may still try to rely on that clause, but if you bring a case and demand a jury, your lawyer can move to have that waiver declared void and unenforceable.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Point you to specific cases applying GOL \u00a7 5\u2011321 in the landlord\u2013tenant context, or  \n- Help you understand how this would play out procedurally if you were to file a case.",

Under New York law a written, knowing jury\u2011trial waiver can be enforceable, but residential lease waivers are treated with close scrutiny and often can be challenged and set aside.\n\nWhat matters\n- Clear, unequivocal language and a signature (or initials) make a waiver more likely to be enforced.  \n- Whether the tenant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right is critical. A boilerplate clause buried in fine print, or one in a take\u2011it\u2011or\u2011leave\u2011it lease for a non\u2011commercial tenant, is more vulnerable.  \n- Courts consider bargaining power and whether the clause was negotiated. Residential tenants are often considered unsophisticated parties and courts may view the clause as an unconscionable adhesion term.  \n- The clause\u2019s scope matters: some waivers try to cover \u201cany claims\u201d while others attempt to limit to contract claims; ambiguity is construed against the drafter.  \n- Public\u2011policy concerns can weigh against enforcing waivers in tort cases (personal injury) where the right to a jury is fundamental.\n\nPractical effect\n- If the clause is enforced, you lose the right to a jury trial but not the right to bring the claim \u2014 the case proceeds to a bench trial before a judge.  \n- If you\u2019ve been injured, don\u2019t assume the waiver is effective \u2014 you can and should assert your right to a jury in your court filings and be prepared to oppose a motion to strike the jury demand.\n\nWhat you should do now\n1. Don\u2019t delay \u2014 personal injury claims have a statute of limitations (in NY it\u2019s generally 3 years from the injury).  \n2. Have a lawyer or a tenant\u2011law/consumer clinic review the exact lease language and the facts of how the lease was signed (was it negotiated, was the clause conspicuous, were you represented, etc.). Legal Services NYC, The Legal Aid Society, and the NYC Bar Legal Referral Service can help if you need low\u2011cost or pro bono help.  \n3. If you sue (or are sued), assert a jury demand and be ready to oppose enforcement of the waiver on grounds such as ambiguity, lack of knowing consent, unconscionability, adhesion contract, or public policy.\n\nIf you want, paste the exact jury\u2011waiver clause here (and tell me whether you negotiated the lease or it was a standard form, and whether you initialed/signaled next to the clause). I can give more specific guidance about how strong a challenge would be.",
            "llama3": "A clever question!\n\nIn most states, leases are governed by the laws of contract and property, not tort law (the area of law dealing with personal injuries). As a result, clauses in a lease that affect your constitutional rights, such as the right to a jury trial, may be unenforceable.\n\nIn general, you cannot waive your constitutional rights, including the right to a jury trial, through a contract like a lease. This is because the Constitution grants these rights to individuals and cannot be taken away by private agreement.\n\nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to a trial by jury in civil cases involving amounts exceeding $20 (although some states have their own higher limits). This means that if you were to sue your landlord for personal injury or property damage, you would still have the right to a jury trial, even if your lease says otherwise.\n\nThat being said, there may be limited exceptions. For example:\n\n1. If the clause is part of a larger agreement that complies with applicable laws and regulations (e.g., a commercial lease with a waiver of jury trial for breach of contract claims).\n2. In cases where the waiver is deemed reasonable under specific circumstances (e.g., if you're an adult signing a lease in a situation where you have equal bargaining power).\n\nTo be sure, consult with a lawyer who is familiar with your state's laws and regulations. They can help you understand your rights and any potential implications of suing your landlord.\n\nRemember: it's always a good idea to carefully review your lease and seek legal advice if you're unsure about the terms or have concerns about enforcing your constitutional rights."

If the clause is ambiguous, a court may construe it against the drafter and treat it as reciprocal \u2014 but don\u2019t count on that.\n- Statutory exceptions: Some statutes and claims allow prevailing tenants to recover fees regardless of the lease (for example, certain federal or state civil-rights or consumer\u2011protection laws, and some housing\u2011related statutes). Whether a statute applies depends on the nature of your claim.\n- Practical steps: If you want the protection, try to negotiate a mutual \"prevailing\u2011party\" attorneys\u2019 fees clause before you sign or renew. If you\u2019re already in a dispute, talk to a housing attorney or legal services provider to see whether any fee\u2011shifting statute applies to your case or whether the lease language might be interpreted in your favor.\n\nIf you want, paste the exact clause here (or tell me what kind of claim you\u2019re thinking of), and I can give more specific guidance about whether a court or particular statute might let you recover fees.",

This rule applies unless your lease specifically disclaims or limits the recovery of such fees and costs.\n\nIn your situation, since your lease only allows the landlord to recover attorney's fees and costs if they sue you, it doesn't necessarily mean you're prohibited from recovering them. However, it's always a good idea to review your lease carefully to ensure there are no specific provisions that might limit or disallow your recovery of attorney's fees and costs.\n\nIf you do find yourself in a situation where you need to defend against a landlord lawsuit, be sure to consult with an attorney who is familiar with the laws and regulations governing landlord-tenant disputes in your area.

Common examples:\n   - Waiving the **warranty of habitability** (your right to a safe, livable apartment) \u2013 void under Real Property Law (RPL) \u00a7 235\u2011b.  \n   - Waiving your right to a **court eviction process** (e.g., \u201ctenant agrees landlord can change the locks without court papers\u201d) \u2013 violates RPAPL and is not enforceable.  \n   - Clauses saying you can\u2019t withhold rent *under any circumstances* even if conditions are dangerous or uninhabitable.  \n   - Waiving your right to **join a tenants\u2019 association** or organize with other tenants (RPAPL \u00a7 235\u2011d, others).\n\n2. **Unconscionable clauses (extremely one\u2011sided)**  \n   Under New York\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code and general contract principles, a court can refuse to enforce a clause that was:\n   - imposed in a way that gave you no meaningful choice, and  \n   - is so unfair or one\u2011sided that it \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d  \n\n   In landlord\u2011tenant cases, this is often applied to:\n   - Extreme **fees** or penalties (e.g., wildly excessive late fees, bogus \u201clegal fees\u201d automatically charged without court order).  \n   - One\u2011sided attorney\u2011fee clauses (note: RPL \u00a7 234 often makes these **mutual**, letting tenants recover fees when they win, even if the lease only mentions landlord\u2019s fees).\n\n3. **Clauses that violate specific NYC/NY State housing laws**  \n   Any lease term that contradicts a statute or regulation is usually void. Examples:\n   - **Illegal rent** in a rent-stabilized or rent-controlled apartment, or clauses that attempt to avoid rent regulation.  \n   - Clauses requiring **security deposits above one month\u2019s rent** or allowing non\u2011interest escrow in situations where law requires interest (GOL \u00a7 7\u2011103 and \u00a7 7\u2011108).  \n   - Clauses allowing **self-help evictions** (changing locks, removing doors, shutting utilities) instead of using Housing Court.  \n   - Clauses barring **lawful roommates** in situations where the Real Property Law gives you a right to have one (RPL \u00a7 235\u2011f).  \n   - Clauses attempting to bar you from complaining to **HPD, 311, DOB, or other agencies**, or from reporting code violations.\n\n4. **Overbroad or misleading \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cbehavior\u201d clauses**  \n   A landlord can require reasonable rules, but courts may not enforce:\n   - Clauses that forbid any **guests** or effectively ban normal visitation.  \n   - Clauses that allow eviction for any **minor lease violation** without chance to cure, especially when applied harshly.\n\n5. **Attorney\u2019s fees and \u201cautomatic\u201d charges**  \n   - Lease terms that say you *automatically* owe the landlord\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees whenever they hire a lawyer, even if they don\u2019t win in court, are often trimmed back or not enforced as written.  \n   - Under RPL \u00a7 234, if the lease gives the landlord a right to legal fees when they win, courts will treat that as giving the tenant the same right if the tenant wins.\n\n6. **Illegal \u201creletting\u201d or \u201cbreak lease\u201d fees**  \n   Some break\u2011lease clauses are enforceable as \u201cliquidated damages,\u201d but courts may refuse ones that:\n   - Are clearly a **penalty**, not a reasonable estimate of damages; or  \n   - Charge rent for periods after the landlord has already re-rented; or  \n   - Conflict with the landlord\u2019s duty to **mitigate damages** (New York courts now expect landlords to try to re-rent).\n\n---\n\nTo give you a more precise answer, I\u2019d need the exact wording of the clause and some context:\n\n- Are you rent-stabilized, rent-controlled, or market-rate?  \n- What does the clause say, word-for-word?  \n- How and when was it presented to you (standard form, added rider, handwritten, etc.)?\n\nIf you paste the clause (you can redact names/addresses), I can walk through whether it\u2019s likely enforceable under NYC/NY State law and what practical steps you can take (e.g., sign but later challenge, or negotiate removal).",

Tenants cannot generally waive the warranty of habitability.  \n- Unconscionability / adhesion: Courts examine both procedural unconscionability (was there no real bargaining \u2014 a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d adhesion contract, surprise fine print?) and substantive unconscionability (is the term so one\u2011sided that it shocks the conscience?). Residential leases are scrutinized more strictly than arm\u2019s\u2011length commercial contracts.  \n- Severability: If a court finds one clause invalid, it will often strike or reform that clause and enforce the rest of the lease if the remaining agreement can function.\n\nCommon types of clauses that get challenged\n- Waivers of the warranty of habitability or the right to repairs.\n- Clauses attempting to waive statutory tenant protections (rent\u2011stabilization/regulatory rights; retaliatory eviction protections).\n- Broad exculpatory clauses that absolve the landlord of liability for negligence or willful misconduct (these are less likely to be enforced in residential cases).\n- Terms requiring tenants to give up core legal remedies (in limited circumstances).\n- Extremely one\u2011sided attorney\u2011fee or penalty provisions may be reduced or invalidated.\n\nWhat you can do\n1. Don\u2019t sign if you can avoid it. Ask the landlord to remove or revise the clause in writing.  \n2. If you already signed, keep a copy of the lease and any communications.  \n3. If the landlord tries to enforce the clause, raise defenses in Housing Court or Civil Court (unconscionability, illegality, public policy, violation of rent laws). A judge can refuse to enforce the clause.  \n4. Get help: contact a tenant attorney or tenant legal services (Legal Aid Society, Legal Services NYC, tenant unions, or NYC\u2019s tenant helpline/311 for referrals). For rent\u2011stabilized units, the DHCR may also be able to help.\n\nIf you want, tell me the exact wording of the clause and whether your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011regulated and whether you\u2019ve signed the lease \u2014 I can give more specific guidance about how likely a court is to refuse enforcement and what arguments to raise.",

To be deemed unconscionable, the clause must be so one-sided that it would result in a significant imbalance between the parties' rights and obligations.\n3. **Reasonableness**: Courts will generally uphold lease clauses that are reasonable and proportionate to the landlord's interests.

Consider mediation or arbitration: Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, mediation or arbitration may be a viable alternative to litigation.\n\nIf all else fails, you can file a lawsuit seeking to have the unconscionable clause declared void or modified. A court will then review the lease clause and decide whether it's enforceable.\n\nRemember that each case is unique, and the outcome depends on various factors, including jurisdiction, local laws, and the specific circumstances surrounding your lease agreement.

If you don\u2019t give the required notice, the lease will often roll over for the stated period (often month\u2011to\u2011month or a new fixed term).\n- Practical step: look at the exact wording and any notice deadlines. If you want, I can help read or draft a notice to decline renewal.\n\n2) Rent\u2011stabilized apartments in NYC\n- Different rules apply. For rent\u2011stabilized units the owner must provide a written renewal lease offer during a statutory window before the lease expires (the renewal\u2011offer period set by DHCR). If the owner fails to timely provide the offer you still retain renewal rights and you should contact the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) for guidance or to file a complaint.\n- Rent increases for renewals are governed by the Rent Guidelines Board and not simply by whatever a lease clause says.\n\nWhat you should do now\n- Check whether your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized (look at the lease, the DHCR site, or call 311).\n- Read the automatic\u2011renewal clause carefully to see any required notice period and whether the clause is conspicuous.\n- If you want to avoid renewal, give written notice before the deadline in the lease (send by certified mail or similar so you have proof).\n- If you think the clause is hidden, ambiguous, or you\u2019re in a rent\u2011stabilized unit and the landlord failed to follow the renewal rules, contact NYC 311, DHCR, or a tenants\u2019 rights attorney/legal aid for next steps.\n\nIf you tell me whether your unit is rent\u2011stabilized and paste the automatic\u2011renewal language from your lease, I can give more specific advice and/or draft a notice to opt out.",
            "llama3": "The pesky automatic renewal clause! It's great that you're being proactive about understanding your lease.\n\nIn most states, a landlord is required to provide written notice of the automatic renewal clause to the tenant before the initial lease term expires. This notice period varies by state, but generally, it should be at least 30 days.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Check your state's laws**: Automatic renewal clauses and notification requirements vary by state. Look up your state's specific rules regarding this topic.\n2. **Review your lease agreement**: Study your lease carefully to see if there's a specified notice period or any other requirements mentioned.\n3. **Watch for the notice**: If you don't receive a written notice from your landlord about the automatic renewal clause, it doesn't necessarily mean you're off the hook. However, having proof of the notice can be helpful in case of disputes.\n4. **Understand the consequences**: If you don't renew or vacate the premises by the end of the initial lease term, the automatic renewal clause may kick in, binding you to a new lease term. This could result in increased rent, changed terms, or other unfavorable conditions.\n\nTo be safe, consider sending your landlord a formal request for clarification on their procedures regarding automatic renewal clauses and notice periods. You can say something like:\n\n\"Dear [Landlord's Name],\n\nI'm reviewing my lease agreement and noticed the automatic renewal clause. Can you please confirm whether you will provide written notice of this clause at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial lease term? If so, what specific details will I need to know about the new lease terms?\n\nThank you for your prompt response.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\"\n\nBy asking these questions and understanding your lease agreement, you'll be better equipped to navigate any potential issues that may arise when your lease is up for renewal."

Common practice:\n\n- Once you sign a renewal offer and return it, and the landlord accepts (by signing, or sometimes by conduct, such as continuing the tenancy at the new rate), the renewal is considered in effect as of the **start date** in the lease.\n- Landlords often treat the higher rent as due starting the date listed in the renewal, even if their signed copy is delayed.\n\nIf this is your situation, check:\n\n- The **language of the lease** (it might say when the increase becomes effective).\n- Any **emails or letters** about the renewal.\n\n---\n\n## What you should do now\n\n1. First, confirm:  \n   - Does your lease say \u201crent\u2011stabilized,\u201d or  \n   - Do you have a DHCR rent history, or  \n   - Is your building built before 1974 with 6+ units?  \n   If yes to any, you may be stabilized.\n\n2.

The rules are stricter for regulated apartments and the agency (DHCR) can help \u2014 if it is, tell me and I\u2019ll add the specific DHCR rules.\n\nGeneral (non\u2011regulated) apartments\n- There is no New York City law that fixes a single specific number of days for the landlord to send you a fully executed copy after you sign a renewal. The landlord should sign and return a copy \u201cpromptly,\u201d but a statutory deadline usually does not apply to ordinary private-market leases.\n- That said, once the renewal offer is signed and returned, the renewal terms (including any rent increase) take effect when the new lease term begins or when the landlord accepts the renewal (for example, by cashing/depositing a rent check at the new rate or otherwise treating you as renewed). To avoid claims of non\u2011payment or late fees, you should pay the rent due for the new lease term on time \u2014 i.e., the increased amount if that is what the signed renewal says \u2014 even if you have not yet received the landlord\u2019s signature back.\n- If you want to protect yourself while you wait for the landlord\u2019s signed copy, make any payment at the new rate by check or money order and keep a copy; you can annotate the payment \u201cunder protest\u201d or \u201cpayment of rent under reservation of rights\u201d if you\u2019re worried about the landlord later claiming something different.\n\nRent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled apartments\n- There are additional rules and required forms for renewals. Landlords must use DHCR renewal forms and there are timing and disclosure requirements. If the landlord fails to provide a copy of the fully executed renewal, DHCR can assist and there are remedies available.\n- Even in a regulated apartment, you should pay the increased legal rent when the renewal term begins to avoid exposure for nonpayment; and you should keep proof that you paid.\n\nPractical steps to protect yourself\n1. Keep your signed copy and proof you sent it (certified mail receipt, delivery confirmation, scan of email attachment).\n2. Send a short written request (certified mail or email) asking for a fully executed copy and asking the landlord to return it within a short deadline (for example, 7\u201314 days). Keep a copy.\n3. Pay the rent due on the first day of the renewed term at the increased rate shown on the lease (unless you have a specific legal reason not to), and keep proof of payment. If you want, note the payment \u201cunder protest.\u201d\n4. If the landlord refuses to return a signed copy, refuses to accept timely payment, or threatens eviction, contact DHCR (if rent\u2011stabilized), 311/NYC Housing Preservation & Development, or a tenants\u2019 attorney/Legal Aid/tenant hotline. You can also bring a case in housing court if the landlord tries to evict for nonpayment.\n\nIf you tell me whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized / rent\u2011controlled or provide any other details (for example, the landlord has already cashed a new\u2011rate check or hasn\u2019t responded at all), I can give more specific steps and, if relevant, the DHCR complaint options and sample texts you can send.",

The increase can only start at the beginning of a new month (or whatever your rent period is), with proper notice.\n\n5. **No retaliation or discrimination.**  \n   Even if they follow the notice rules, they cannot raise your rent:\n   - Because you complained to 311/HPD, joined a tenant association, or asserted your rights (retaliatory increase), or  \n   - For discriminatory reasons (race, religion, etc.).  \n\nIf you tell me:\n- whether you have a written lease that expired,  \n- your current monthly rent,  \n- when they told you about the increase and when they want it to start, and  \n- whether you think the unit might be rent\u2011stabilized (building size, age, etc.),  \n\nI can tell you more precisely whether this increase is likely legal and what your options are (including how to respond in writing).",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: No \u2014 your landlord can\u2019t just raise the rent on a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy without your agreement and without giving you proper advance notice. Exactly what\u2019s required depends on whether the apartment is rent\u2011regulated (rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled) or not.\n\nWhat to know and do\n\n1. Is the apartment rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled?\n- If it is rent\u2011stabilized, the landlord must follow Rent Guidelines Board increases and statutory renewal procedures. They must offer a renewal lease in the timeframe required by law; they cannot impose an arbitrary increase just because you\u2019re month\u2011to\u2011month. Check DHCR or your lease for stabilization status or contact 311/DHCR for help.\n- If it is rent\u2011controlled the same general rule applies \u2014 regulated limits and procedures control any increase.\n\n2. If the apartment is NOT rent\u2011regulated\n- A landlord may propose a rent increase for a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy, but they must give you written notice before the increase takes effect. Generally, changes to the terms of a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy require advance notice equal to the rental period (commonly 30 days for month\u2011to\u2011month tenancies). You do not have to accept the raise \u2014 you can:\n  - accept it, or\n  - refuse and move out by the effective date, or\n  - refuse and remain in the apartment and continue to pay the current rent. (If you refuse to pay an increased amount the landlord is demanding and they start eviction proceedings, you can raise defenses in court \u2014 keep proof you paid the prior rent.)\n\n3. Practical steps\n- Ask the landlord to put the increase in writing, stating the new rent and the date it will take effect.\n- Check whether your unit is rent\u2011stabilized (look at your lease for \u201crent stabilization\u201d language, rent history, or ask DHCR).\n- If you don\u2019t agree, do not sign any new lease or rent\u2011increase notice. Continue paying the current rent on time and keep receipts.\n- If the landlord threatens eviction or attempts illegal pressure or retaliation, contact NYC 311 for referrals or seek free/low\u2011cost tenant legal services (NYC Legal Aid, neighborhood legal clinics). NYC has a Right to Counsel program for many eviction cases.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether your apartment is rent\u2011stabilized or share the notice your landlord gave (or the exact words they used). I can help you draft a short written response and tell you what notices the landlord must give in your situation.",
            "llama3": "The answer depends on the laws of your state or locality. In general, landlords typically need to provide notice and follow specific procedures before increasing rent on a month-to-month tenancy.\n\nIn the United States, there is no federal law that requires a landlord to obtain a tenant's consent before raising the rent. However, many states have their own laws governing rent increases on month-to-month leases.\n\nSome common scenarios:\n\n1. **Month-to-Month Lease with No Notice Requirement**: In some states, like California, Florida, and Texas, landlords can increase rent without prior notice as long as they provide a 30-day written notice to the tenant.\n2. **Month-to-Month Lease with Required Notice**: In other states, like New York and Washington D.C., landlords may need to provide a specific amount of written notice (e.g., 15-60 days) before increasing rent.\n3. **Rent Control Jurisdictions**: If you live in an area with rent control laws (e.g., San Francisco or New York City), the landlord may be restricted from raising rent without permission from the local rent control board.\n\nTo determine if your landlord can raise your rent without your agreement, check:\n\n1. Your lease agreement: Review your month-to-month lease to see if it specifies any procedures for rent increases.\n2. Local laws and regulations: Research the laws in your state or locality regarding rent increases on month-to-month tenancies.\n3. Consult with a tenant advocate: If you're unsure about your specific situation, consider consulting with a local tenant advocacy organization or an attorney specializing in landlord-tenant law.\n\nRemember to always keep a record of any correspondence with your landlord, including dates and details of discussions, emails, or letters.

Basic deadline: 4\u2011year lookback rule (plus some extensions)\nFor most overcharge claims (rent\u2011stabilized):\n\n- **You can file an overcharge complaint with DHCR** (Form RA\u201189) or start a court case in Housing Court.\n- DHCR and the court will generally look back **4 years** from the date you file to determine the legal rent and any overcharge.\n- You can normally recover **up to 6 years** of overcharges in court, but calculation of the \u201clegal regulated rent\u201d still usually uses the 4\u2011year lookback baseline, unless there\u2019s fraud or certain other issues.\n\n**Key citations (for orientation only):**  \n- Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) \u00a7 26\u2011516  \n- CPLR \u00a7 213\u2011a (4\u2011year lookback) & \u00a7 213 (6\u2011year limitation for money claims)  \n- Grimm v. DHCR and subsequent \u201cfraud\u201d cases allow looking past 4 years in some situations.\n\n### 2. When you get a renewal lease with an increase\nIf you get a renewal lease (rent\u2011stabilized):\n\n- The landlord must offer the renewal on the **official RTP\u20118 form** (DHCR form) with the correct guideline increases.\n- You normally must **sign and return** a proper renewal **within 60 days** or you risk issues with continuation of your tenancy and potential late\u2011fees/arrears.\n- If you think the rent is wrong but don\u2019t want to risk non\u2011renewal, you can:\n  - Sign \u201cunder protest\u201d and keep paying, and\n  - File an **overcharge complaint** or a **\u201clease violation/renewal lease\u201d complaint** with DHCR.\n\nThere is **no special ultra\u2011short deadline** (like 30 days) in the rent laws for challenging the legality of the increase itself; the practical deadline is still based on the 4\u2011year window. But it\u2019s best to act **within weeks/months**, not years, to avoid evidentiary problems and big back\u2011rent disputes.\n\n### 3. Rent\u2011controlled apartments\nFor rent\u2011controlled apartments (fewer units are still rent\u2011controlled):\n\n- Challenges to rent increases (e.g., MBR increases, fuel cost adjustments) also generally must be brought within **4 years** of the overcharge collection.\n- The mechanism is also a complaint to DHCR, though the forms and calculation rules are different from rent\u2011stabilized.\n\n### 4. When the clock starts\nThe 4\u2011year period is measured **back from the date you file** the overcharge claim. For example:\n\n- If your rent was raised on 10/1/2022 and you file with DHCR on 3/1/2026:\n  - DHCR looks back to around 3/1/2022.\n  - Any overcharges collected **before** that date are normally outside the lookback, unless there\u2019s fraud or a special exception.\n\nSo, you don\u2019t \u201close all rights\u201d simply because you didn\u2019t challenge in the first month, but you will lose older overcharges as time passes.\n\n### 5. Exceptions \u2013 fraud, deregulation schemes, missing registrations\nIf there\u2019s evidence of **fraud** (for example: fake improvements, falsified leases, illegal deregulation, big unexplained jumps when the apartment was stabilized again), courts and DHCR can:\n\n- Look back **beyond four years** to establish the legal rent, and\n- Potentially award **treble damages** (triple the overcharge) for up to 6 years if the overcharge was willful.\n\nThese cases are fact\u2011specific and typically require documentation.\n\n### 6. Practical advice\n- **Don\u2019t wait**: Even though the technical limit is 4 years (and up to 6 for recovery in court), you should act as soon as you suspect an illegal increase.\n- **Collect documents**: leases, renewal forms (RTP\u20118), DHCR rent history, rent registration printouts, proof of payments, any IAI/MCIs notices.\n- **File with DHCR** or consult a tenant attorney / legal services group if:\n  - The increase is higher than the Rent Guidelines Board percentages.\n  - There was a big rent jump at vacancy or after work the landlord claims to have done.\n  - Your apartment was previously \u201cderegulated\u201d and then re\u2011stabilized.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- whether you\u2019re rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled,\n- the date and amount of the increase,\n- and whether you\u2019ve ever gotten your **DHCR rent history**,\n\nI can walk you through exactly what deadline applies and which form/strategy is best right now.",

Act quickly \u2014 the clock runs from the date each overcharge occurred.\n\nA few important details and next steps:\n- Rent\u2011stabilized apartments: DHCR will usually only review/award refunds for overcharges that occurred within the 4 years before you file. You can file an administrative overcharge complaint with DHCR (and raise overcharge as a defense if the landlord sues you for nonpayment).\n- Rent\u2011controlled apartments or court claims: different rules can apply. If you bring a civil suit in court rather than an administrative claim, general New York statutes of limitations (often 6 years for money claims) may be relevant. Still, DHCR is normally the right place to start for regulated apartments.\n- Special charges/increases: Certain increases (MCI/IAI, preferential rent issues, registration failures) have their own rules or evidentiary consequences; failing to register the legal regulated rent can affect remedies.\n- What to do now: Get your rent history from DHCR (request a Rent History), preserve all notices/leases, and file an overcharge complaint with DHCR as soon as possible. If you\u2019re being sued for nonpayment after a disputed increase, raise the overcharge as a defense immediately and consider getting legal help.\n\nIf you tell me whether your unit is rent\u2011stabilized or rent\u2011controlled (and roughly when the increase started), I can give more specific steps and form names/links.

The law sets guidelines for rent increases, and I'll explain how it works.\n\n**Maximum Rent Increase:**\n\nThe maximum allowed rent increase is determined by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB), which is an independent board that reviews evidence presented by landlords, tenants, and other stakeholders to set the annual rent adjustment.\n\n**How the RGB calculates the maximum rent increase:**\n\n1. The RGB receives data from landlords on their actual operating costs, including expenses for repairs, maintenance, utilities, taxes, insurance, and other relevant factors.\n2. The board also considers evidence presented by tenant advocacy groups, which may argue that rent increases should be lower to ensure affordability and fairness.\n3. After reviewing all the data, the RGB sets a maximum allowed rent increase percentage for each rent-stabilized building or apartment complex.\n\n**The maximum rent increase is typically around 2% to 4%:**\n\nIn most years, the maximum rent increase is relatively modest, usually ranging from 2% to 4%. This means that if your rent was $1,000 last year, the landlord would be allowed to raise it to around $1,020 to $1,040 this year.\n\n**Keep in mind:**\n\n* The RGB's decision applies only to new leases and renewals; existing tenants can't be forced to pay more than their current rent.\n* Rent-stabilized apartments are subject to annual rent increases, which can add up over time. However, the law also requires landlords to maintain their buildings and provide certain services.\n\nAs a rent-stabilized tenant, you're protected from excessive rent hikes. If you have concerns about your rent increase or believe it's unfairly high, consider speaking with a tenant advocate or housing attorney for guidance."

            "gpt-5.1": "Yes, but only in specific ways and with limits, and the rules changed significantly in 2019.\n\nIn NYC rent\u2011stabilized apartments, landlords can charge permanent rent increases for building\u2011wide work through **Major Capital Improvements (MCIs)**, but:\n\n### 1. What qualifies as an MCI?\nWork must be:\n- Building\u2011wide or for the benefit of all tenants (or a substantial number)\n- A new installation or full replacement (not just repair)\n- Depreciable under the IRS Code (equipment, systems, etc.)\n- Necessary for the operation, preservation, or maintenance of the building\n\nTypical MCI\u2011eligible items:\n- New boiler or heating system\n- New roof\n- New windows building\u2011wide\n- New plumbing risers or electrical system upgrades\n- New elevator or full elevator replacement\n- Local Law 11 fa\u00e7ade work (if it meets requirements)\n\nNon\u2011eligible examples:\n- Ordinary repairs/maintenance\n- Cosmetic work (paint, minor patching, some lobby d\u00e9cor)\n- Work done only in one or a few apartments (that may be an IAI, not an MCI)\n\n### 2. The 2019 law changes (HSTPA)\nFor rent\u2011stabilized apartments:\n- **Increase is temporary**: MCI increases now last **30 years**, not permanent.\n- **Cap on increase**:\n  - 2% per year maximum MCI increase for rent\u2011stabilized units (replacing the old 6%/15% caps).\n- Landlord must **apply to DHCR** (New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal) and cannot just raise your rent on their own.\n\n### 3. Process your landlord must follow\n1. **Complete the work** and pay for it.\n2. **File an MCI application with DHCR**, including contracts, invoices, cancelled checks, permits, and proof the work was building\u2011wide and properly completed.\n3. **DHCR notifies tenants** and sends forms:\n   - You have the right to **object in writing** (within the deadline on the notice).\n4. DHCR reviews:\n   - Whether the cost is legitimate and not padded\n   - Whether it\u2019s truly an MCI\n   - Whether services are being maintained (no MCI increase if there are serious service reductions)\n5. If approved, DHCR issues an **order** allowing a specified rent increase.\n\nUntil DHCR issues an **order**, your landlord **cannot legally collect** the MCI increase.\n\n### 4. How your rent might be affected\n- The MCI increase is added to your **legal regulated rent** and collected monthly.\n- It\u2019s **subject to the 2% cap per year** for rent\u2011stabilized tenants.\n- The increase **expires after 30 years**.\n- If you receive SCRIE/DRIE or other rent freeze benefits, your portion may be handled differently; those programs may freeze your share at pre\u2011MCI rent.\n\n### 5. You can challenge an MCI application\nYou can object if:\n- The work is not truly building\u2011wide or not a qualifying MCI.\n- The landlord didn\u2019t actually do or complete the work.\n- The costs are inflated or include ineligible items (e.g., professional fees, repair portions).\n- There are outstanding building\u2011wide conditions: lack of heat/hot water, serious maintenance problems, HPD violations.\n- The work is correcting conditions caused by the landlord\u2019s own neglect.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to:\n- Keep DHCR notice and deadlines.\n- Submit a written response to DHCR (you can attach photos, HPD violation printouts, heat\u2011logs, etc.).\n\n### 6. What your landlord **cannot** do\n- Unilaterally raise your rent for a boiler or other building work **without DHCR approval**.\n- Charge you more than the DHCR\u2011approved amount.\n- Retroactively apply an MCI increase for periods before the DHCR order (they can\u2019t collect increases before the effective date stated in the order).\n- Add MCI costs to your rent if the work is primarily for correcting code violations caused by long\u2011term neglect (DHCR often disallows or reduces in those cases).\n\n---\n\nIf you want, you can tell me:\n- The type of work done\n- Whether you received DHCR MCI notices\n- The increase amount and your current rent  \n\nand I can help you assess whether the proposed increase likely complies with current NYC rent stabilization rules.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: Yes \u2014 but only if the landlord follows the legal procedure for a Major Capital Improvement (MCI). They cannot unilaterally raise rent for building-wide work on a rent\u2011stabilized apartment without DHCR/HCR approval.\n\nWhat that means in plain terms\n- Replacing a boiler or installing building\u2011wide equipment is the kind of work that can qualify as an MCI.  \n- The landlord must file an MCI application with New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR, formerly DHCR) and get approval. If approved, HCR allows a rent increase based on the approved cost amortized across stabilized units.  \n- The landlord must provide tenants with required notices and documentation; the increase is not automatic and cannot be imposed without HCR action.  \n- There are limits, caps, and rules (for example, overlapping public tax abatements or government funding for the same work can reduce or bar an MCI pass\u2011through).\n\nTenant rights and options\n- Ask the landlord in writing for a copy of the MCI application/approval and a breakdown of costs.  \n- You can request your apartment\u2019s legal rent history from HCR to verify any increase.  \n- If you believe the work does not qualify as an MCI, costs are inflated, it was already paid for by a tax abatement, or the landlord failed to follow procedure, you can challenge the increase with HCR and/or seek legal help.  \n- If you cannot afford an approved MCI increase, you may have hardship defenses \u2014 consult legal aid or a tenant attorney. Don\u2019t stop paying the lawful portion of rent without legal advice.\n\nWhere to get help\n- New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR/DHCR) handles MCI filings and disputes. Check their website or contact them to see if an MCI was filed for your building.  \n- Local tenant legal services or a tenant association can help you review documents and file an objection.\n\nIf you want, tell me (1) whether your building is rent\u2011stabilized, (2) whether you received a notice or an increase, and (3) whether you want help drafting a document requesting the MCI paperwork or checking HCR records \u2014 I can draft that for you.",
            "llama3": "In New York City, where rent stabilization regulations apply, the answer depends on several factors. Generally speaking, landlords are allowed to increase rents to cover certain capital improvements that benefit all tenants equally, such as replacing a boiler or installing new equipment.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) approval**: For rent-stabilized buildings, any rent increases related to building-wide capital improvements must be approved by the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB). The RGB sets the annual rent increase percentage, which is then applied to the base rent.\n2. **Capital improvements that benefit all tenants**: To justify a rent increase, the improvement must directly benefit all tenants in the building, not just one or a few specific units. Examples include:\n\t* Replacing a boiler, furnace, or other essential equipment\n\t* Upgrading electrical systems or plumbing infrastructure\n\t* Installing new elevators, stairs, or other common areas\n3. **Reasonable rent increase**: The rent increase should be reasonable and proportional to the value of the improvement. The RGB will consider factors such as:\n\t* The cost of the capital improvement\n\t* The extent to which it benefits all tenants\n\t* The landlord's ability to finance the project without passing excessive costs to tenants\n4. **Notification and documentation**: Your landlord must notify you in writing about the planned improvement, including details on the scope, cost, and expected rent increase. You should receive this notice at least 30 days before the proposed rent increase takes effect.\n5. **Rent stabilized building rules**: In a rent-stabilized building, any rent increase related to capital improvements can only be applied to your base rent (not the stabilized rent). Your landlord must also provide you with an updated Rent Stabilization Lease Registration Statement reflecting the new rent.\n\nTo confirm whether your landlord's planned improvement is valid and whether it will affect your rent, review your lease or consult with a tenant advocacy organization, such as the New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) or the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty (MCJP)."

Confirm the basics\n\n- **Building size:** More than 35 apartments \u2192 use **1/180** amortization factor.\n- **Date of IAI:** Rules below apply to IAIs **on or after June 14, 2019.**\n- **Cap:** IAIs after this date are subject to a **$15,000 cap in any 15\u2011year period per apartment**, including all IAIs done in that window.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Step-by-step calculation\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Determine eligible IAI cost**\n\nStart with the **actual, documented cost** of the improvement:\n- Must be for qualifying work (e.g., new kitchen, new bath fixtures, electrical upgrade, etc., not ordinary repairs).\n- Must be paid for by the owner (receipts, contracts, canceled checks).\n- Combine all eligible IAI work done at one time into a total.\n\n**Then apply the $15,000 / 15\u2011year cap:**\n- If total eligible cost > $15,000, only the **first $15,000** counts for the rent increase.\n- If there were prior IAIs in the same apartment in the last 15 years, those costs count toward that $15,000 cap.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apply the amortization factor**\n\nFor buildings with **more than 35 apartments**, the rent increase is:\n\n> **Annual increase = (Allowable IAI cost) \u00f7 180**\n\nExample:  \nAllowable IAI cost = $15,000  \nAnnual legal rent increase = $15,000 \u00f7 180 = **$83.33 per month**\n\nThis amount is added to the **legal regulated rent**.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Temporary duration**\n\n- This IAI increase becomes part of the legal rent but is **only collectible for 30 years** (after HSTPA).\n- After 30 years, the IAI portion must be removed from the collectible rent.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Important limits\n\n- **15-year spending cap:** No more than **$15,000 in IAI costs** can be used to raise rent in one apartment over any **15\u2011year** period.\n- **Verification:** Landlord must be able to show:\n  - Itemized invoices/contracts\n  - Proof of payment\n  - That work was actually done in your apartment\n- **Vacancy status:** Whether the IAI was done while the apartment was vacant or occupied matters for consent and disclosures, but **not for the arithmetic** of the increase.\n\n---\n\n### 4. If the work was done before June 14, 2019\n\nThe calculation was different before HSTPA:\n- No $15,000 cap.\n- For buildings with more than 35 apartments, the formula was typically **1/60 of the IAI cost** added to monthly rent (and it was permanent), but the rules about deregulation and stacking with vacancy increases have changed.\n- Exact treatment depends on the date of the work and whether the unit is rent\u2011stabilized.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The **year** the IAI was done,\n- The **claimed cost**, and\n- Your building\u2019s **stabilization status**,\n\nI can walk you through the specific dollar amount your landlord should be charging under current law and how to check it against your lease/rent history.",
            "gpt-5-mini": "Short answer: for a rent\u2011stabilized apartment in a building with more than 35 units, the permanent monthly increase for an Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI) is the landlord\u2019s allowable IAI cost divided by 40 (i.e., 1/40th of the cost).\n\nExample: if the allowable documented cost of the work was $8,000, the permanent increase = $8,000 \u00f7 40 = $200/month.\n\nA few practical points\n- \u201cAllowable cost\u201d generally means the documented amounts the owner actually paid for the improvement (materials, labor, contractor fees, permits, etc.) that qualify under the Rent Stabilization rules. Not every item a landlord lists may be allowed.\n- The IAI increase becomes part of the legal regulated rent (permanent).\n- Tenants have the right to ask the landlord for proof of the costs and can challenge an improper IAI increase with the NYC Office of Rent Administration/DHCR if they believe the charge is incorrect.\n\nIf you want, tell me the amount the landlord says they spent and I\u2019ll calculate the monthly increase and suggest what documents to request.",
            "llama3": "A Permanent Rent Increase (PRI) calculation! That's a crucial aspect of individual apartment improvements in NYC.\n\nWhen a landlord completes an Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI), they are entitled to a permanent rent increase, which is calculated based on the cost of the improvement and the pre-IAI rent. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Cost of the IAI**: The landlord must provide you with a written estimate or invoice for the cost of the improvement.\n2. **Pre-IAI Rent**: The original rent per month, before the IAI was done, is used as the baseline.\n3. **Percentage Increase**: The landlord calculates the percentage increase in rent by dividing the cost of the IAI by the pre-IAI monthly rent.\n\nThe calculation formula is:\n\n( Cost of IAI / Pre-IAI Monthly Rent ) x 100\n\nFor example, let's say the landlord spent $10,000 on an IAI and the pre-IAI monthly rent was $2,500. The percentage increase would be:\n\n( $10,000 / $2,500 ) x 100 = 400%\n\nThis means that the landlord can increase your rent by 4 times the original rent (since 400% is equivalent to a 4-fold increase).\n\n**Permanent Rent Increase**: To determine the permanent rent increase, multiply the percentage increase by the pre-IAI monthly rent:\n\n$2,500 (pre-IAI rent) x 4 (percentage increase) = $10,000\n\nSo, your new rent would be $10,000 per month.\n\nRemember to carefully review the calculation and ensure that you understand the figures involved. If you have any questions or concerns, it's always a good idea to consult with an attorney specializing in NYC tenant law."
